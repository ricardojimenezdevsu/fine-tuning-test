to match a desired traffic profile. Traffic shaping is used to optimize or guarantee performance, improve latency, or increase usable bandwidth for some kinds of traffic by delaying other kinds. The most common type of traffic shaping is application-based traffic shaping, where fingerprinting tools are first used to identify applications of interest, which are then subject to shaping policies. With east–west traffic, a service mesh can generate or monitor the fingerprints, such as service identity or some other proxy for this, or a request header containing relevant metadata—for example, whether a request originated from a conference application free-tier user or a paying customer.      Traffic policing   Traffic policing is the process of monitoring network traffic for compliance with a traffic policy or contract and taking steps to enforce that contract. Traffic violating a policy may be discarded immediately, marked as noncompliant, or left as is, depending on administrative policy. This technique is useful to prevent a malfunctioning internal service from committing a denial of service (DoS) attack, or to prevent a critical or fragile internal resource from becoming overly saturated with traffic (e.g., a data store). Before the advent of cloud technologies and service meshes, traffic policing within internal networks was generally only implemented within an enterprise context using specialized hardware or software appliances such as an enterprise service bus (ESB).
