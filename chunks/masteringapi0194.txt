Discussion Points  Have we identified and prioritized all of our requirements associated with selecting a service mesh?  Have we identified current technology solutions that have been deployed in this space within the organization?  Do we know all of our team and organizational constraints?  Have we explored our future roadmap in relation to this decision?  Have we honestly calculated the “build versus buy” costs?  Have we explored the current technology landscape and are we aware of all of the available solutions?  Have we consulted and informed all involved stakeholders in our analysis and decision making?    Recommendations  Focus particularly on your requirement to reduce internal API/system coupling, simplify consumption, protect APIs from overuse and abuse, understand how APIs are being consumed, and manage APIs as products.  Key questions to ask include: is there an existing service mesh in use? Has a collection of technologies been assembled to provide similar functionality; e.g., have developers created service-to-service communication libraries or have platform/SREs team deployed sidecar proxies?  Focus on technology skill levels within your team, availability of people to work on a service mesh project, and available resources and budget, etc.  It is important to identify all planned changes, new features, and current goals that could impact internal traffic management and the other functionality that a service mesh provides.
