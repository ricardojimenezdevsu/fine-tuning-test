Authorization Code Grant applied to our case study      Refresh Tokens   It is good practice to issue tokens that are short-lived; however, asking a user to reenter their username and password would soon become a jarring experience. A refresh token is a long-lived token used by the client to request additional access tokens when the previous token expires. Refresh tokens are requested as part of the authorization request, meaning the end user is not involved in requesting further access tokens. As part of the latest security best practices, the detection of a refresh token used twice immediately revokes the active refresh token. Refresh tokens are an additional credential and long-lived, so it is important that these are kept secure and not leaked. If at any point a client needs to be denied access, including if the resource owner does not want the client to have further access to their resources, the refresh token can be revoked. The next time the client application requests a new access token (which are short-lived) they will be stopped.
