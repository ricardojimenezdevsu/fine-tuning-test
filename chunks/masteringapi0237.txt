undetectable ways whereby the user is able to take advantage of the privileges without the knowledge of system administrators. Elevation of privilege threats include those situations where an attacker is allowed more privilege than should properly be granted, completely compromising the security of the entire system and causing extreme system damage. Here the attacker has effectively penetrated all system defenses and become part of the trusted system itself and can do anything.      You can use this acronym when evaluating your system at each point of your architecture to see what threats exist. There are also other threat modeling methodologies that can be used.8  As you look at the data flow diagram in Figure 6-2, you can see the boundary that exists between the client application and the API gateway. An API gateway is often located at the edge of our network and can also be internet-facing, as you learned in “Where Is an API Gateway Deployed?”. You are going to explore a number of different threats related to the API gateway and learn how this can be used to protect your system against many of the common API vulnerabilities. If you protect your system at the edge, the risks can often be reduced throughout your system, but this is not always the case. You will learn more about the move from zonal architecture, where traffic inside your security perimeter is treated differently than traffic outside, toward zero-trust models, where traffic is constantly re-authenticated, in
