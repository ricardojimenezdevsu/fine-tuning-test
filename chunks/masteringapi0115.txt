be costly when dealing within a large number of requests. Figure 3-6 shows how an API gateway can provide aggregation of backend service calls and translation of protocols.      Figure 3-6. An API gateway providing aggregation and translation      Protect APIs from Overuse and Abuse: Threat Detection and Mitigation   The edge of a system is where your users first interact with your applications. It is also often the the point where bad actors and hackers first encounter your systems. Although the vast majority of enterprise organizations will have multiple security-focused layers to their edge stack, such as a content delivery network (CDN) and web application firewall (WAF), and even a perimeter network and dedicated demilitarized zone (DMZ), for many smaller organizations the API gateway can be the first line of defense. For this reason, many API gateways include security-focused functionality, such as TLS termination, authentication/authorization, IP allow/deny lists, WAFs (either inbuilt or via external integration), rate limiting and load shedding, and API contract validation. Figure 3-7 highlights how an allow/deny list and rate-limiting can be used to mitigate abuse of APIs.      Figure 3-7. API gateway overuse and abuse      A big part of this functionality is the capability to detect API abuse, either accidental or deliberate, and for this you will need to implement a comprehensive observability strategy.
