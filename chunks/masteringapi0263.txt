API gateway. There could be multiple services behind the API gateway but for the client the API gateway would still be the resource server as it is hosting the protected resources. The two resource owners in this case are the attendees using the mobile app and the speakers using the CFP system.      Figure 7-4. API gateway as the resource server      JSON Web Tokens (JWT)   JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Web Tokens are an RFC standardized token format that is the de facto standard token for OAuth2. A JSON Web Token, also known as a JWT (pronounced “jot”), consists of claims and these claims have associated values. JWTs are structured and encoded using standards to ensure the token is unmodifiable and additionally can be encrypted. They are especially useful in the transfer of information in “space constrained environments such as HTTP Authorization headers”.  Here is an example JWT:   { "iss": "http://mastering-api/", "sub": "18f913b1-7a9d-47e6-a062-5381d1e21ffa", "aud": "Attendee-Service", "exp": 1618146900, "nbf": 1618144200, "iat": 1618144200, "jti": "4d13ba71-54e4-4583-9458-562cbf0ba4e4" }  In this example the claims are iss, sub, aud, exp, nbf, iat and jti—these are all reserved claims in the JWT RFC. Reserved claims have a special meaning. They are not mandatory in a token, however they offer a starting point for a minimum amount of information. Looking at our example token, let’s list what the claim abbreviations are and how they are typically used:  iss (Issuer)
