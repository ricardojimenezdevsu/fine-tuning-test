half of a group is affected, the score is a 3; and if no one is affected, the score is 0.  For the case study, all the threats identified are collected, scored, and then prioritized. In this case the highest-priority item is the lack of DDoS protection for the API gateway. As you identified in this section of the chapter, the mitigation to this issue is to implement rate limiting and load shedding for within the API gateway.      Other Risk Evaluation Tools   There are other ways to evaluate threats—one of them is DREAD-D (pronounced Dread minus D). In the DREAD risk calculation, one of the D’s is Discoverability, which in some cases could be security through obscurity, which is a terrible way to protect any data. So the Discoverability element is dropped; this why it is called DREAD-D. Another tool that can be used is the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), which can be used to measure the severity (i.e., the damage) of an exploited vulnerability. CVSS is used by NIST to evaluate CVEs, so if you ever look at a CVE, a CVSS can be found. For example, you can see this looking at the Log4J CVE and the NIST CVSS.      Step 6: Validation   The sixth and final step of the threat modeling process is to validate that your security objectives are complete and ask if another review is needed. As part of threat modeling, you should have evaluated all the threats that are discovered and identified and taken action to mitigate the risks. You also want to ensure that you have
