to create an opinionated platform is most successful when the developers of the platform are involved in the design process. In the guideline in Table 5-3, you will explore what points to consider and the importance of involving developers to create a successful opinionated platform.  Table 5-3. ADR Guideline: Opinionated platforms Decision  Should you adopt an opinionated platform for your deployments and releases?    Discussion Points  What are our languages for developing software in the organization? Is it possible to center around a few to live within the opinionated platform?  Is the organization set up in a way where you can empower developers as customers and run the opinionated platform as an internal product?  What are the constraints or features that are going to add benefit to introducing a platform? For example, should monitoring and observability be features supplied out of the box to developers?  How do you update the platform recommendations and help provide changes to teams already using the platform?    Recommendations  Consider developers as customers of the platform product and create a mechanism that supports developers providing input.  The key features should be as transparent as possible to developers (e.g., configures a library to introduce open telemetry).  New applications always get the latest features in the stack. However, how do you ensure that existing platform users can easily get access to the latest features?      Summary   In this chapter
