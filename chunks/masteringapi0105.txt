URL to a backend system, a solution that provides ingress will typically also be required to provide reliability, observability, and security.  As you will learn throughout this chapter, an API gateway isn’t the only technology that can provide these requirements. For example, you can use a simple proxy or load balancer implementation. However, we believe it is the most commonly used solution, particularly within an enterprise context, and as the number of consumers and providers increases, it is often the most scalable, maintainable, and secure option.  As shown in Table 3-1, you will want to match your current requirements to the capabilities of each solution. Don’t worry if you don’t understand all of these requirements, as you will learn more about them throughout the chapter.  Table 3-1.
