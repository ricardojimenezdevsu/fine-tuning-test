Type 2 decisions are easy to change: “like walking through a door—if you don’t like the decision, you can always go back.” Usually this concept is presented in relation to confusing the two, and using Type 1 processes on Type 2 decisions: “The end result of this is slowness, unthoughtful risk aversion, failure to experiment sufficiently, and consequently diminished invention. We’ll have to figure out how to fight that tendency.” However, in the majority of cases—especially within a large enterprise context—choosing API-enabling technologies like an API gateway or service mesh is very much a Type 1 decision. Ensure your organization acts accordingly!      Preparing for the Future   When writing a book, we naturally capture experience and knowledge at a fixed point in time. There are always new developments emerging. Following are three topics that we didn’t believe yet warranted full sections but are nonetheless worth keeping an eye on for their future impact on API architecture.      Async Communication   Asynchronous APIs are very popular, falling generally into two categories: client-server and client-broker. An example client-server relationship is achieved with technologies such as gRPC, and the client-broker relationship is achieved using intermediate technologies such as Kafka.
