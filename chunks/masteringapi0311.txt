little value and can affect morale.    Well-established patterns, such as the strangler fig, can increase the speed and safety of evolving a system and prevent the need to reinvent the wheel.      The next chapter builds on the focus of this chapter and extends the scope of evolutionary architecture to also include migrating to cloud infrastructure.      1 For more insight and the history of the big ball of mud, check out these articles from Wikipedia and InfoQ.  2 Sam Newman’s Building Microservices, 2nd Edition (O’Reilly) is our personal favorite.  3 In this context “subject under consideration” is a class or set of classes.  4 For more information on Pace, see “Accelerating Innovation by Adopting a Pace-Layered Application Strategy” by Gartner and “A Pace-Layered Integration Architecture” by Dan Toomey.      Chapter 9. Using API Infrastructure to Evolve Toward Cloud Platforms   In the previous chapter we provided an overview of architectural approaches that you can use when evolving APIs and the services that power them. An equally important topic to consider within the evolution of systems is the underlying infrastructure, platforms, and hardware. Often this changes and evolves on its own rhythm: as hardware breaks, companies and technology become merged or acquired, or organization-wide IT policies dictate that infrastructure be upgraded. However, at times an API program will drive infrastructure changes, particularly in relation to modernization and moving to more
