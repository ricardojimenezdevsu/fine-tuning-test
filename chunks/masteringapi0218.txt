Signals”, we will cover how to make use of the three pillars of observability to operate infrastructure involved with an API platform.    For the three pillars of observability, the OpenTelemetry project is the best place to start. The project provides an open standard in the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), preventing vendor lock-in and facilitating the widest possible compatibility. Although metrics and tracing standards have been created and are stable, logging is a slightly more difficult problem to solve (due to the vast array of different possible emitters), but it is also covered in the OpenTelemetry project.      Important Metrics for APIs   Considering which metrics are important for an API platform is a key decision that will help discover outages early, and possibly even prevent them. You could measure and gather a wide range of different metrics, but some metrics will also be dependent upon your platform. Rate, Error, Duration (RED) metrics are often noted as one approach to measuring traffic-based service architectures. Part of the appeal is that these metrics provide a good overview of what is going on at a point in time. Rate shows how many requests per second a service is processing (or throughput), what errors are returned, and the duration (or latency) of each request. In the Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) world, these metrics help us to derive The Four Golden Signals—latency, traffic, errors, and saturation.  Perhaps one of the biggest
