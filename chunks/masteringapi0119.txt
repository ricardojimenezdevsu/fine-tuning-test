understanding of the “what,” “where,” and “why” of API gateways, it is time to take a glance backward through history before looking forward to current API gateway technology. As Mark Twain was alleged to have said, “history doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes,” and anyone who has worked in technology for more than a few years will definitely appreciate the relevance this quote has to the general approach seen in the industry. Architecture style and patterns repeat in various “cycles” throughout the history of software development, as do operational approaches. There is typically progress made between these cycles, but we collectively need to be careful not to miss the teachings that history has to offer.  This is why it is important to understand the historical context of API gateways and traffic management at the edge of systems. By looking backward we can build on firm foundations, understand fundamental requirements, and also try to avoid repeating the same mistakes.      1990s Onward: Hardware Load Balancers   The concept of the World Wide Web (WWW) was proposed by Tim Berners-Lee in the late 1980s, but this didn’t enter the consciousness of the general public until the mid-1990s, where the initial hype culminated in the dot-com boom and bust of the late ’90s. This “Web 1.0” period drove the evolution of web browsers (Netscape Navigator was launched late 1994), the web server (Apache Web Server was released in 1995), and hardware load balancers (F5 was founded in
