implementation itself.      Repudiation   According to STRIDE, a repudiation attack happens when an application or system does not adopt controls to properly track and log users’ actions, which permits malicious manipulation or forging the identification of new actions. For many requests that are made to an API, it is important to understand the details of the request, the payload, and the response generated (and corresponding internal actions). In certain regulatory or compliance use cases, you may need to arbitrarily inspect what was in an exchange. If a request can be repudiated—i.e., there is no proof of what the attacker has done—then the attacker can reject or disagree that they have tried to perform any such malicious action. This is why repudiation threats (the “R” in STRIDE) are included in STRIDE methodology.  To identify requests that are passing through your system and to understand what is happening, you need to add logging and monitoring. Insufficent logging and monitoring is a vulnerability in the OWASP API Top 10. With all requests from users flowing through the API gateway, this is an obvious centralized point to monitor the traffic and to log the requests and responses. Many API gateways will provide this functionality out-of-the-box, but you need to understand how to store, search, and extract this information, particularly over the course of time. As with any disaster recovery and business continuity (DR/BC) capabilities, logging and monitoring must be
