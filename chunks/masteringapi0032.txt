diagrams and their importance in sharing and communicating architecture.    ADRs provide a valuable record for making decisions and have both present and historical value in the lifetime of a project.    You have seen the structure for ADR Guidelines that will be used throughout the book to help facilitate decision making.      With the decision made to break the Attendee service out from the conference system, we will now explore the options for designing and specifying the Attendee API.      1 The intention is it will be the UI accessing the ingress point. However, it is open for potential exploit.  2 Local stubborn traits fueled this likely explanation.      Part I. Designing, Building, and Testing APIs   This section provides the foundational building blocks for API-driven architectures.  In Chapter 1 you will learn about REST and Remote Procedure Call (RPC)â€“based APIs. We will explore specifications and schemas, recommended standards, strategies for versioning, and how to choose the right API for your system.  In Chapter 2 you will learn about testing APIs and how different test styles are best applied to API-driven architectures.      Chapter 1. Design, Build, and Specify APIs   You will be presented with many options when designing and building APIs. It is incredibly fast to build a service with modern technologies and frameworks, but creating a durable approach requires careful thought and consideration. In this chapter we will explore REST and RPC to model the
