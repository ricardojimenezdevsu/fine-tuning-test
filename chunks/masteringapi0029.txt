rejected ADR and most teams choose to keep ADRs immutable to capture the change in perspective. ADRs work best when they are presented in a location where key participants can view them, comment, and help move the ADR to accepted.      Tip   A question we often get asked is at what point should the team create an ADR? It is useful to ensure that there has been discussion ahead of the ADR and the record is a result of collective thinking in the team. Publishing an ADR to the wider community allows the opportunity for feedback beyond the immediate team.      Attendees Evolution ADR   In Figure I-4 we made the decision to take an evolutionary step in the conference system architecture. This is a major change and would warrant an ADR. Table I-1 is an example ADR that might have been proposed by the engineering team owning the conference system.  Table I-1. ADR001 separating attendees from the legacy conference system Status Proposed  Context  The conference owners have requested two new major features to the current conference system that need to be implemented without disrupting the current system. The conference system will need to be evolved to support a mobile application and an integration with an external CFP system. Both the mobile application and the external CFP system need to be able to access attendees to log in users to the third-party service.    Decision  We will take an evolutionary step as documented in Figure I-4 to split out the Attendee component into a
