use SAML 2.0, often referred to as just SAML. SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) is an open standard that transfers assertions. It is often used for single sign on, and the assertions that are transferred are user identities. SAML is popular within the enterprise world as it is used to allow employees to sign on to external applications. SAML is not aligned to be used by APIs in its raw form. However, there does exist an OAuth2 extension: Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0 Profile for OAuth 2.0 Client Authentication and Authorization Grants. This extension allows a client to request an access token using SAML, assuming that the authorization server has implemented the functionality. You should be aware of this if SAML is something that you need to use as part of a migration to OAuth2.      Summary   In this chapter we have explored the importance of securing APIs and robust industry standards to achieve this:  Authentication establishes the identity of the resource owner, which in APIs is either an end user or an application performing system-to-system communication.    OAuth2 is the de facto standard for securing APIs and often leverages JWT as part of the bearer header. JWT tokens are often encoded and signed to ensure they are tamper free.    Different OAuth2 grants support different scenarios. The most common are the Authorization Code Grant + PKCE and the Client Credentials Grant.    Refresh tokens help to smooth out the end-user experience of needing
