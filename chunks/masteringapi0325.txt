additional strong, trustworthy security controls that are beyond the scope of this guideline.    Restricted Zone (RZ)  This zone provides a controlled network environment generally suitable for business-critical IT services or large repositories of sensitive information and supports access from systems in the Public Zone via a PAZ and an OZ.      This approach to perimeter-based network design is somewhat similar to the old “castle and moat” defense, in that an attacker will struggle the most at the ingress point, but once inside the castle walls, they will generally have an easier time navigating around. This is largely because assumptions are made about any communication originating from within the system perimeter, network, or location. However, cloud infrastructure can challenge these assumptions. In many cloud platforms, the geographical and network location of the underlying infrastructure is abstracted away or not available. Even with protections in place from cluster providers, there is still the risk of a supply chain attack, where software is manipulated with malicious content at build time. Another possibility is a malicious user at the infrastructure provider’s site, accessing information from the platform level.  Running different types of security across different types of deployment is possible, however a more homogeneous approach reduces the risk of assumptions being made and the requirement to learn different security techniques. There is inherent trust
