No one wants a mouthguard where the only testing takes place during the match!  2 SLOs and SLIs will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 5.  3 To learn more on agile testing, check out the books Agile Testing (O’Reilly), More Agile Testing (O’Reilly), or the video series Agile Testing Essentials.  4 The typical example of a unit in object-oriented (OO) languages is a class.  5 Test doubles include stubs, which look like real implementations of an external entity, except they return hardcoded responses. Mocks look like real implementations of preprogrammed objects, but instead are used to verify behavior.  6 Kent Beck’s book Test Driven Development: By Example (Addison-Wesley) is a fantastic resource for learning more about TDD.  7 To clarify, it is also possible that a service can be both a producer and consumer.  8 A stub server is a service that can be run locally and will return canned responses.  9 At the time of writing, there are a few projects that are available, though none are actively maintained, so it is difficult to recommend any.  10 Pact does a good job of comparing itself to other contract frameworks.  11 These testing libraries usually have a Domain Specific Language (DSL) and make it easy to analyze responses from the API.
