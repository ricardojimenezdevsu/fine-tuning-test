custom hardware. For example, older specialist systems may assume that all communication within the system occurs over a local bus or dedicated network connections (which isn’t the case in the cloud), and certain datastore technologies assume specific hardware characteristics (or guarantees) of the underlying block storage system. When in doubt, do your research.    Rehosting could be a viable approach for our case study, although we have chosen the option of replatforming to allow us to take advantage of some cloud features.      Replatform   This approach is sometimes referred to as “lift-tinker-and-shift.” It is very similar to rehosting but also takes advantage of some cloud services that require minimal re-work. For example, an existing datastore that is run as a system component may be swapped out for a protocol-compatible cloud service. You could swap a native MySQL datastore with a MySQL-compatible AWS RDS, an Azure Database, or GCP Cloud SQL. Another common replatforming is to update or change a language-specific application server or container.  This is the approach we have chosen for our conference system case study, so we can avoid major rework while still taking advantage of new cloud services as we migrate away from our existing on-premise infrastructure.      Repurchase   Repurchase primarily involves moving to a different product—for example, subscribing to a SaaS-based email-sending service rather than continuing to run an email server in-house.  As our
