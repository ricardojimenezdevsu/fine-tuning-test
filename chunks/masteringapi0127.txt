built on top of this.  With the increasing adoption of Kubernetes and the open source release of the Envoy Proxy in 2016 by the Lyft Engineering team, many API gateways were created around this technology, including Ambassador Edge Stack (built upon the CNCF Emissary-ingress), Contour, and Gloo Edge. This drove further innovation across the API gateway space, with Kong mirroring functionality offered by the next generation of gateways and other gateways being launched, such as Traefik, Tyk, and others.      Confusion in the Cloud: API Gateways, Edge Proxies, and Ingress Controllers   As Christian Posta noted in his blog post “API Gateways Are Going Through an Identity Crisis”, there is some confusion around what an API gateway is in relation to proxy technologies being adopted within the cloud computing domain. Generally speaking, in this context an API gateway enables some form of management of APIs, ranging from simple adaptor-style functionality operating at the application layer (OSI layer 7) that provides fundamental cross-cutting concerns, all the way to full lifecycle API management. Edge proxies are more general-purpose traffic proxies or reverse proxies that operate at the network and transport layers (OSI layers 3 and 4, respectively), provide basic cross-cutting concerns, and tend not to offer API-specific functionality. “Ingress Controllers” are a Kubernetes-specific technology that controls what traffic enters a cluster and how this traffic is handled.
