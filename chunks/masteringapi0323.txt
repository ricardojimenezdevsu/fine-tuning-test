multiple networks, you will most likely need to consult your InfoSec teams, as this will disrupt the traditional approach to perimeter defenses and zonal architecture. Let’s explore this topic in more depth and learn how the move to zero trust networks can help.      From Zonal Architecture to Zero Trust   Before learning how modern API gateways and service meshes can help you implement zero trust networks, let’s first explore the traditional approach to zonal network architecture.      Getting in the Zone   As the commercial internet grew in popularity, more and more regulated industries began providing access to applications. This meant that both new systems and existing internal systems were made to be user facing. The emergence of zonal architectures provided a best practice in designing secure networks. Zoning is used to mitigate the risk of a completely open or flat network by segmenting infrastructure services into logical groupings that have the same networking security policies and security requirements. Consider a vulnerability like Log4Shell (CVE-2021-44228), a zero-day vulnerability posing significant risk to Java applications using affected Log4J libraries. Using the exploit, an attacker could gain access to a host in a network and start to run malicious activities. The range of impact and services under exploit is known as the blast radius of the attack. If all untrusted requests enter a zone that has access to very little high-value information, the blast
