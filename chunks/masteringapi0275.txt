use the access token when it calls the Attendee API.  You have now seen how to use OAuth2 for machine-to-machine communication, but what if your case has not been covered so far?      Tip   Refresh tokens are not used with the Client Credentials Grant; instead, the client requests a new access token.      Additional OAuth2 Grants   There are more OAuth2 grants available than just the previous two discussed. The other standardized grants available are listed here, but we will not explore them in further detail:  The Device Authorization Grant is used for devices that have limited input or lack a browser. This makes it useful for IoT devices, such as your smart fridge or a Raspberry Pi project.    Implicit Grant was used commonly for SPAs, but it has been replaced by the Authorization Code Grant + PKCE.    Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant was historically used as a stepping stone from HTTP Basic to get client applications off the ground using OAuth2. It is recommended not to use this grant.      ADR Guideline: Choosing Which OAuth2 Grants to Support   As we have seen, there are many OAuth2 grants. It is important to pick the grant that is right for your case or the grants you want to support. The ADR Guideline in Table 7-2 provides discussion points and considerations you should think about before picking your grant.  Table 7-2.
