Director’s global control plane that enables global routing, load balancing, and regional failover for service mesh and load-balancing use cases. Traffic Director even supports a “hybrid” mode of operation, including deployments that incorporate both sidecar proxy-based services and proxyless services, as shown in Figure 4-8.      Figure 4-8. Example network diagram of services using both sidecars and proxyless communication      As our conference system uses REST APIs in addition to gRPC APIs, this would currently exclude this choice of a service mesh implementation. If our use of REST APIs internally was deprecated, or the gRPC libraries are enhanced to provide support for non-gRPC-based communication, using this approach could be reevaluated.      Is the Future of Service Mesh Proxyless?   As the popular cliché goes, although history doesn’t repeat itself, it often rhymes. Many of the benefits and limitations of the proxyless approach are similar to those when using language-specific libraries. The Google Cloud team has called out the following use cases as examples on when proxyless deployment of service could be beneficial:  Resource efficiency in a large-scale service mesh: saving resources from not running additional sidecar processes    High-performance gRPC applications: reducing networking hops and latency    Service mesh for environments where you can’t deploy sidecar proxies: for example, a second process can’t be executed, or a sidecar can’t manipulate the
