chapter of the book, you will explore emerging API technologies that may play a bigger role in the future and learn how we keep up-to-date with these changing best practices, tools, and platforms.      Case Study: A Look Back on Your Journey   Throughout the book, we have been making evolutionary steps to update and mature the conference system architecture use case that we began with. You can see the starting point in Figure 10-1.      Figure 10-1. Original conference system architecture      Letâ€™s look at some of the decisions taken in extracting the Attendee service. As shown in Figure 10-2, and discussed in the Introduction, we made the decision (based on requirements from the conference system stakeholders) to extract the attendees, functionality into an API-based service that would be run as a standalone process external from the legacy conference system.      Figure 10-2. Extracting the Attendee service from the conference system      In Chapters 1 and 2, the architecture remained static while we explored how to design and test the Attendee API and service. In Chapter 3 we took our first big evolutionary step, introducing an API gateway between the end-user customer and the existing conference system and new service.  As shown in Figure 10-3, the customer now makes requests to the conference system via the API gateway, which provides an abstraction and single point of entry for traffic bound to either the legacy conference system or the new Attendee service.
