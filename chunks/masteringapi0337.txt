critical to consistently describing and specifying REST APIs.  The AsyncAPI is an exciting and developing standard to provide a specification for asynchronous APIs. One challenge with asynchronous-based APIs is supporting the variety of protocol formats and range of technologies. It is definitely one to watch as the popularity of event-driven architectures and the need to define exchanges is a rapidly growing space.      HTTP/3   HTTP/3 is the third major version of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol used to exchange information on the World Wide Web, alongside HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2. HTTP semantics are consistent across versions: the same request methods, status codes, and message fields are typically applicable to all versions. The differences are in the mapping of these semantics to underlying transport protocols. Both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 use TCP as their transport (as in TCP/IP). HTTP/3 uses QUIC, a transport layer network protocol that uses UDP. The switch to QUIC aims to fix a major problem of HTTP/2 called “head-of-line blocking,” which in particular affects websites that require multiple resources to load.  HTTP/3 promised potentially big speed gains, but as the underlying transport protocol has changed, this will require upgrades to ingress proxies and other networking components. The good news is that as of the time of writing, HTTP/3 is already supported by more than 70% of running web browsers.      Platform-based Mesh   As hinted within Chapter 4, many signals are
