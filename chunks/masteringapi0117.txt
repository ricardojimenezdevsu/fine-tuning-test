Manage APIs as Products: API Lifecycle Management   Modern APIs are often designed, built, and run as products that are consumed by both internal systems and third parties, and they must be managed as such. Many large organizations see APIs as a critical and strategic component and, as such, will create an API program strategy and set clear business goals, constraints, and resources. With a strategy set, the day-to-day tactical approach is often focused on API lifecycle management. Full lifecycle API Management (APIM) spans the entire lifespan of an API that begins at the planning stage and ends when an API is retired. Many of the stages within the lifecycle are heavily coupled to the implementation provided by an API gateway. For these reasons, choosing an appropriate API gateway is a critical decision if you are supporting APIM.  There are multiple definitions for key API lifecycle stages, and we believe that the Axway team strikes a good balance with defining 3 key components—create, control, and consume—and 10 top stages of an API lifecycle:  Building  Designing and building your API.    Testing  Verifying functionality, performance, and security expectations.    Publishing  Exposing your APIs to developers.    Securing  Mitigating security risks and concerns.    Managing  Maintaining and managing APIs to ensure they are functional, up-to-date, and meeting business requirements.    Onboarding  Enabling
