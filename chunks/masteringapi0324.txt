radius is minimized and security operations have time to act to prevent serious outage. Zones tend to cascade, with each traversal into the next zone applying more defense-in-depth mitigation to challenge the inbound traffic.  The zones are separated by perimeters (Zone Interface Points) implemented through security and network devices. Zoning is a logical design approach used to control and restrict access and data communication flows only to those components and users as per security policy.  There are many approaches to defining zones and the associated security requirements, both standardized (often at the country level) and bespoke. However, as shown in Figure 9-3, four typical zones are found in most zonal architectures:2      Figure 9-3. A typical zonal architecture, taken from the Canadian governmentâ€™s ITSG-22      Public Zone (PZ)  This zone is entirely open and includes public networks such as the public internet, the public switched telephone network, and other public carrier backbone networks and services.    Public Access Zone (PAZ)  This zone mediates access between operational systems and the Public Zone and often includes a demilitarized zone (DMZ).    Operations Zone (OZ)  An OZ is the standard environment for routine operations and with appropriate security controls at the end systems. This zone may be suitable for processing sensitive information; however, it is generally unsuitable for large repositories of sensitive data or critical applications without
