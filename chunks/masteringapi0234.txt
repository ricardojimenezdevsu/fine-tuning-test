leakage to prevent being sued or being compliant with regulations like GDPR. If these are just sourced from your immediate area, then you do not have a complete picture of the most important issues that face your organization. Your objectives for the Attendee service is to prepare the API for external consumption by third parties by ensuring that the OWASP Top 10 are mitigated.      Step 2: Gather the Right Information   Once you have the goals in mind, Step 2 of threat modeling is acquiring the information about how the system works. With threat modeling, you need to bring in experts on each area of the system and associated codebases or products. This is to ensure that you understand how everything works and that no hidden assumptions are made. For the Attendee API, this will require bringing in members of the team who work across all of your components; mobile, gateway, databases, and Attendee service.      Step 3: Decompose the System   The third step of the threat modeling process is to create a diagram of the system that shows the component interactions with the flow of data. The information gathered collaboratively is then used to create the DFDs. Creating diagrams can be time-consuming, so we recommend using dedicated threat modeling tooling. For the case study data flow diagram, shown in Figure 6-2, we used the Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool, although other tools are available.5      Figure 6-2.
