testing. This became popularized in the book Agile Testing by Lisa Crispin and Janet Gregory (Addison-Wesley). The technology side of building an API cares that it has been built correctly, that its pieces (e.g., functions or endpoints) respond as expected, and that it is resilient and continues to behave under abnormal circumstances. The business cares that the right service is being developed (i.e., in our case, that the Attendee API provides the right functionality). To clarify, the term “the business” means someone who has a clear understanding of the product and the features and the functionality that should be developed; they need not have a technical understanding.  The test quadrant brings together tests that help technology and business stakeholders alike—each perspective will have different opinions on priorities. The popular image of the test quadrant is shown in Figure 2-2.      Figure 2-2. Agile Test Quadrants from Agile Testing (Addison-Wesley) by Lisa Crispin and Janet Gregory      The test quadrant does not depict any order. The quadrants are labeled for convenience and this is a common source of confusion that Lisa describes in one of her blog posts. The four quadrants can be generally described as follows:  Q1  Unit and component tests for technology. These should verify that the service that has been created works, and this verification should be performed using automated testing.    Q2  Tests with the business. These ensure what is being built is serving a
