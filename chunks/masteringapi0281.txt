These scopes are used in the context of ID tokens—you would not see these scopes in your access token as you saw in “OAuth2 Scopes”.  Three flows are declared by OIDC: Authorization Code Flow, Implicit Flow, and Hybrid Flow. The OIDC specification calls steps to acquire an ID token “flows.” The recommendation is to use the Authorization Code Flow for the same reasons as the Authorization Code Grant (+ PKCE)—it is more secure.  Many people think that OAuth2 and OIDC are the same thing and will refer to OIDC being used to access APIs. The reality is that they are not the same; they are two distinct things. OIDC has its role, providing user identity to clients; however, it does not provide access to APIs. If OIDC is something that you need, then you should be sure that your identity provider has support for it. Do not try to build your own identity layer.      Warning   Never substitute ID tokens for access tokens. This is very dangerous practice as ID tokens are not intended for this purpose. They are long-lived tokens with the purpose of providing information about the user to a client. They are not for accessing resources.      SAML 2.0   In enterprise environments it is common to
