conference system context diagram      Letâ€™s zoom in to the conference system box in Figure I-2. Expanding the conference system provides us more detail about its major technical building blocks. The customer interacts with the web application, which invokes APIs on the conference application. The conference application uses SQL to query the backing datastore.      Figure I-2. C4 conference system container diagram      Figure I-2 reveals that from an API perspective the most interesting functionality is within the conference application container. Figure I-3 zooms in to this specific container, allowing you to explore the structure and interactions.  Four major components and the database are involved in the current system. The API Controller faces all incoming traffic from the UI and makes a decision about where to route the request in the system. This component would also be responsible for marshaling from the on the wire network-level representation to an object or representation in code. The API Controller component is intriguing from the perspective of in-process routing and acting as a junction point or front controller pattern. For API requests and processing, this is an important pattern; all requests pass through the controller, which makes a decision on where the request is directed. In Chapter 3 we will look at the potential for taking the controller out of process.  The Attendee, Booking, and Session components are involved in translating the requests into
