traffic is routed through an edge gateway.    Building on the concepts of managing traffic at the (ingress) edge of systems, you have learned about service-to-service communication and how to avoid common pitfalls such as deploying an API gateway as a less-functional enterprise service bus (ESB).    The combination of all of this knowledge has equipped you with the key thinking points, constraints, and requirements necessary to make an effective choice when selecting an API gateway for your current use cases.    As with most decisions a software architect or technical leader has to make, there is no distinct correct answer, but there often can be quite a few bad solutions to avoid.      Now that you have explored the functionality that API gateways provide for managing north–south ingress traffic and related APIs, the next chapter will explore the role of service meshes for managing east–west, service-to-service traffic.      1 Cindy Sridharan’s O’Reilly book Distributed Systems Observability is a great primer for learning more about the topic of observability.  2 See, for example, OpenZipkin b3 headers.  3 Examples include Apigee Edge and 3Scale.  4 Martin Fowler’s take on StranglerFigApplication.  5 If you are new to this space, then the Learning from Incidents website is a fantastic jumping-off point.      Chapter 4. Service Mesh: Service-to-Service Traffic Management   In the previous chapter you explored how to expose your APIs and manage associated ingress traffic from
