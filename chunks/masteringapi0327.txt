authorize everywhere.    Focus your monitoring on everything in regard to access: users, devices, and services.    Don’t trust any network, including your own.    Choose and design services for zero trust.      The eight principles outlined are perfectly reasonable, however they are very tricky to consider in zonal architecture. The concept of a zone’s trust assumptions would challenge many of these points. For example, a zonal architecture often only authenticates a user once at the edge of the system, and all networks within the perimeter are trusted by default. Let’s explore how we can potentially evolve to a zero trust–based architecture.      Role of Service Mesh in Zero Trust Architectures   Zero Trust Architecture, published by NIST in 2020, is a fantastic document in defining zero trust and key architectural considerations. Service mesh and API gateways combined provide a fantastic platform for implementing zero trust–based architectures. Using service mesh helps provide a homogeneous modeling of how your architecture components are represented and how the traffic flows between them. Underlying technologies enable a concrete model around running process identity and management of certificates helps to assert and prove identity. Integration of active tracing and monitoring enables analysis at all points in the platform, both for users but also for underlying services and Kubernetes pod health. All ingress traffic must have a strong challenge, often asserting that
