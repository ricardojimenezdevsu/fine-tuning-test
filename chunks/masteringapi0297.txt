reviewed what would be a good set of API metrics to publish; this could be measured and enforced by an ongoing fitness function.    Performance  Performance tests are often an afterthought; however, if you can set out latency and throughput targets, these can be measured in the build pipeline. Perhaps one of the hardest parts to this objective is getting production-like data to make the type of performance tests you’d need to run be meaningful. We will consider this further in “Performance Issues”.    Compliance  This section is very business/organization-specific in terms of assessing what is critical to monitor. It could include audit or data requirements that are key to continuing to provide evidence that a business is running as expected.    Security  Security has many different aspects to it and you explored some of the considerations in Chapters 6 and 7. One possible fitness function might be to analyze the library dependencies in the project and check for any known vulnerabilities. Another could be to run an automated scan over the codebase to ensure that there are no OWASP-style vulnerabilities present.    Operability  Many applications are built, put into production, and then start to evolve; users onboard and then problems start. Deciding on a minimum set of requirements for operating the platform is key to ensuring the plant remains operational. Assessing whether monitoring and alerting are in place is a good place to start.      Creating ADRs around the fitness
