Software architecture has been defined as those decisions that are both important and hard to change. These are the decisions that will make your project succeed—or fail.  The authors’ focus is not on architecture in the abstract, but on how you apply architecture within your own organizations. Deciding to adopt an API gateway or a service mesh, and which one, is exactly the kind of hard-to-undo decision that you should approach with caution and evaluate carefully. James, Daniel, and Matthew give strong, opinionated guidance where they feel it is appropriate, and where the options are less clearcut, they provide a framework to help you make the best choice for your circumstances.  They illustrate throughout with a practical and realistic case study that takes the concepts and shows how you actually make them work in practice. Their case study evolves throughout the book, in the same way real systems do. The authors show that you don’t have to do everything upfront; you can evolve your architecture piece by piece, extracting services and adding tools like API gateways and service meshes as you find you need them.  When I built my first APIs, I made a lot of mistakes. I wish I’d had a book like this, to help me understand where I might trip up, and to guide me towards sensible decisions.  I recommend this book to anyone leading work on systems where APIs play a major role. With it, you should be able to develop a consistent set of tools and standards to support every team
