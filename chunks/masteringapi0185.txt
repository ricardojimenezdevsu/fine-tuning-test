version: v2  With Istio installed and the preceding VirtualServices and DestinationRules configured, you can begin routing traffic and API calls between the Attendee and Session services. It really is this easy to get started, although configuring and maintaining Istio in a production environment can be more involved. Istio will handle the routing and also generate telemetry related to each connection. Let’s learn more about observability using the Linkerd service mesh.      Observing Traffic with Linkerd   You can install Linkerd into a Kubernetes cluster by following the “Getting Started” instructions. Linkerd’s telemetry and monitoring features are enabled automatically, without requiring you to make any configuration changes to the default installation. These observability features include:  Recording of top-line (“golden”) metrics (request volume, success rate, and latency distributions) for HTTP, HTTP/2, and gRPC traffic    Recording of TCP-level metrics (bytes in/out, etc.) for other TCP traffic    Reporting metrics per service, per caller/callee pair, or per route/path (with Service Profiles)    Generating topology graphs that display the runtime relationship between services    Live, on-demand request sampling      You can consume this data in several ways:  Through the Linkerd CLI, e.g., with linkerd viz stat and linkerd viz routes    Through the Linkerd dashboard and prebuilt Grafana dashboards    Directly from Linkerd’s built-in Prometheus instance      To gain
