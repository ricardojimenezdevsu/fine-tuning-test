interservice authorization with intentions that allow you to define service-to-service communication permissions by service name.  Intentions control which services can communicate with each other and are enforced by the sidecar proxy on inbound connections. The identity of the inbound service is verified by its TLS client certificate, and Consul provides each service with an identity encoded as a TLS certificate. This certificate is used to establish and accept connections to and from other services.9 The sidecar proxy then checks if an intention exists that authorizes the inbound service to communicate with the destination service. If the inbound service is not authorized, the connection will be terminated.  An intention has four parts:  Source service  Specifies the service that initiates the communication. It can be the full name of a service or be “*” to refer to all services.    Destination service  Specifies the service that receives the communication. This will be the “upstream” (service) you configured in your service definition. It can be the full name of a service or also be “*” to refer to all services.    Permission  Defines whether the communication between source and destination is permitted. This can be set to either allow or deny.    Description  Optional metadata field to associate a description with an intention.      The first intention you will create changes the “allow all” policy, where all traffic is allowed unless denied in specific rules, to a “deny
