Capture or process error information }      Examples and Mocking   The OAS can provide example responses for the paths in the specification. Examples, as we’ve discussed, are useful for documentation to help developers understand the expected API behavior. Some products have started to use examples to allow the user to query the API and return example responses from a mock service. This can be really useful in features such as a developer portal, which allows developers to explore documentation and invoke APIs. Another useful feature of mocks and examples is the ability to share ideas between the producer and consumer ahead of committing to build the service. Being able to “try out” the API is often more valuable than trying to review if a specification would meet your requirements.  Examples can potentially introduce an interesting problem, which is that this part of the specification is essentially a string (in order to model XML/JSON, etc.). openapi-examples-validator validates that an example matches the OAS for the corresponding request/response component of the API.      Detecting Changes   OpenAPI Specifications can also be helpful in detecting changes in an API. This can be incredibly useful as part of a DevOps pipeline. Detecting changes for backward compatibility is very important, but first we need to understand versioning of APIs in more detail.      API Versioning   We have explored the advantages of sharing an OAS with a consumer, including the speed of
