REST if payload bandwidth is a cumulative concern or the service exchanges large volumes of data. If large volumes of data exchanges are frequent, it is also worth considering some of the asynchronous capabilities of gRPC.      Tip   HTTP/3 is on the way and it will change everything. HTTP/3 uses QUIC, a transport protocol built on UDP. You can find out more in HTTP/3 explained.      Vintage Formats   Not all services in an architecture will be based on a modern design. In Chapter 8 we will look at how to isolate and evolve vintage components, as older components will be an active consideration for evolving architectures. It is important that those involved with an API architecture understand the overall performance impact of introducing vintage components.      Guideline: Modeling Exchanges   When the consumer is the legacy conference system team, the exchange is typically an east–west relationship. When the consumer is the CFP team, the exchange is typically a north–south relationship. The difference in coupling and performance requirements will require the teams to consider how the exchange is modeled. You will see some aspects for consideration in the guideline shown in Table 1-3.  Table 1-3. Modeling exchanges guideline Decision  What format should we use to model the API for our service?    Discussion Points  Is the exchange a north–south or east–west exchange? Are we in control of the consumer code?  Is there a strong business domain across multiple services or do we
