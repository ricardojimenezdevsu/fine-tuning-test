course, come with a trade-off in that a full proxy requires more resources and potentially introduces more overhead/latency on communications.      Although less common in comparison with an API gateway, some service meshes provide additional features that enable developers to manage the lifecycle of an API. For example, an associated service catalog may assist with the onboarding and management of developers using the service APIs, or a developer portal will provide account administration and access control. Some service meshes also provide auditing of policies and traffic management in order to meet enterprise governance requirements.      Where Is a Service Mesh Deployed?   A service mesh is deployed within an internal network or cluster. Large systems or networks are typically managed by deploying several instances of a service mesh, often with each single mesh spanning a network segment or business domain.      Is a Service Mesh Deployed at the Edge?   Although deployed within a cluster, a service mesh may expose endpoints within a network demilitarized zone (DMZ), or to external systems, or additional networks or clusters. This is frequently implemented by using a proxy that is referred to as a “mesh gateway,” “terminating gateway,” or “transit gateway.” These types of external gateways do not typically provide the level of functionality commonly found within an externally facing API gateway. There is some debate as to whether traffic management involving these service
