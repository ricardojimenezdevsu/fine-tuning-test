Table 4-1. ADR Guideline: Service mesh or libraries guidelines Decision  Should you use a service mesh or a library for routing service traffic?    Discussion Points  Do you use a single programming language within your organization?  Do you only require simple service-to-service routing for REST or RPC-like communication?  Do you have cross-functional requirements that will require more advanced features, such as authentication, authorization, or rate limiting?  Do you already have a solution in place, or is there an organization-wide mandate that all traffic must be routed through certain components within your network?    Recommendations  If your organization mandates the use of a single programming language or framework, you can typically take advantage of the language-specific libraries or mechanisms for service-to-service communication.  Always use the simplest solution for your requirements, with an eye to the immediate future and known requirements.  If you have advanced cross-functional requirements, particularly across services that use different programming languages or technology stacks, a service mesh may be the best choice.  Always perform due diligence within your organization for existing mandates, solutions, and components.
