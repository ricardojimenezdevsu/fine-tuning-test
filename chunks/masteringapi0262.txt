When the resource owner is a person, it is referred to as an end-user.

Most identity providers, such as Google or Auth0, will be OAuth2 authorization servers.      Client  An application making protected resource requests on behalf of the resource owner and with its authorization.    Resource Server  The server hosting the protected resources, capable of accepting and responding to protected resource requests using access tokens.      Authorization Server Role with API Interactions   The authorization server has two endpoints:  The authorization endpoint is used when a resource owner needs to authorize access to protected resources.    The token endpoint is used by the client to get an access token.      If the Attendee service was called directly by the client, then the Attendee service would be the resource server as it is hosting protected resources. However, a resource server does not need to be an individual application; it could represent a complete system. One popular pattern is to use the API gateway as a resource server, as shown in Figure 7-4. The two clients, the mobile application and the CFP system, are calling the Attendee service via an
