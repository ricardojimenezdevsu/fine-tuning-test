mesh gateways is north–south or east–west, and this can impact requirements and the required security policies, etc.      An example service mesh networking topology is shown in Figure 4-3.

A modern networking stack can have many layers, particularly when working with cloud technologies where virtualization and sandboxing occur at multiple levels. A service mesh should work in harmony with these other networking layers, but developers and operators also need to be aware of potential interactions and conflict. Figure 4-4 shows the interaction between physical (and virtualized) networking infrastructure, a typical networking stack, and a service mesh.      Figure 4-4. OSI model showing that a service mesh operates between layers 3 and 7      As an example, when deploying applications into a Kubernetes cluster, a Service can locate and address another Service within the same cluster via a prescribed name that maps to an IP address. Fundamental traffic control security policies can be implemented with NetworkPolicies, which control traffic at the IP address and port level (OSI layer 3 or 4), and additional policy controls are often provided by a cluster’s Container Networking Interface (CNI) plug-in.2  Service meshes can override the default CNI service-to-IP address resolution
