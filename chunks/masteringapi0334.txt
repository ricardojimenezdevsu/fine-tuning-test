external (user-facing) authentication and authorization.      Figure 10-7. External system communicating with the conference system      In Chapter 9 we focused on migrating the Attendee service and API gateway to a cloud platform, which resulted in the architecture shown in Figure 10-8.      Figure 10-8. Cloud migration to conference system      Finally, in Chapter 9 we provided a potential model for migrating toward a zero trust architecture, with a uniform approach to deployment, routing, and security. In Figure 10-9 there is an option for hybrid architecture while the evolutionary journey continues to the cloud.      Figure 10-9. Cloud migration to conference system using multicluster service mesh      Throughout the case study, our focus has been on highlighting key decision points that you and your team will have to make as a typical system evolves toward becoming API- or service-based. From the humble beginnings of a single service and database running on premises, as you have journeyed toward a multiservice system running across the cloud and on-premises, you have learned that with the increased flexibility this final implementation offers, there are also trade-offs with architecture and infrastructure complexity.  Although this concludes the evolution of our case study in this book, we encourage you to experiment with creating new requirements, designing new APIs, and extracting additional services.
