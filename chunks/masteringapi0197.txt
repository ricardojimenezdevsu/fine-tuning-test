into a graduated Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) project.  2 You can learn more about Kubernetes networking concepts via the official docs: Service, NetworkPolicies, and Container Networking Interface (CNI).  3 Airbnb’s SmartStack was one of the first implementations of external microservice service discovery.  4 You should note that the Finagle RPC framework and Netflix OSS libraries are now both deprecated and not recommended for use in modern production systems.  5 You can learn more via these websites for Fowler’s “Microservice Prerequisites”, “Calçado’s Microservices Prerequisites”, and Phil’s blog “Pattern: Service Mesh”.  6 You can learn more about Traffic Director and the Envoy Proxy–inspired xDS protocol via their respective documentation websites.  7 Learn more about this in “How eBPF will solve Service Mesh—Goodbye Sidecars”.  8 You can learn more about VirtualServices and DestinationRules via the Istio docs.  9 The identity is encoded in the TLS certificate in compliance with the SPIFFE X.509 Identity Document, which enables Connect services to establish and accept connections with other SPIFFE-compliant systems.      Part III. API Operations and Security   In this section you will explore the challenges in operating and securing an API-driven system.  Chapter 5 covers deploying and releasing APIs using an API lifecycle. We will also explore observability topics and how opinionated platforms can help reduce problems with distributed architectures.
