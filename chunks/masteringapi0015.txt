ahead if an area is of interest to you straight away.  In order to present APIs and their associated ecosystem, we will use a series of important artifacts. We will introduce the case study with C4 model diagrams and revisit the specifics and logic behind the approach. You will also learn about the use of Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) and the value of clearly defining decisions across the software lifecycle. As the introduction closes, we will outline ADR Guidelines—our approach to help you make decisions when the answer is “it depends.”      The Architecture Journey   Anyone who has taken a long journey will no doubt have encountered the question (and possibly persistently) “are we there yet?” For the first few inquiries, you look at the GPS or a route planner and provide an estimate—hoping that you don’t encounter any delays along the way. Similarly, the journey to building API-based architectures can be complex for developers and architects to navigate; even if there was an Architecture GPS, what would your destination be?  Architecture is a journey without a destination, and you cannot predict how technologies and architectural approaches will change. For example, you may not have been able to predict service mesh technology would become so widely used, but once you learn about its capabilities it may cause you to think about evolving your existing architecture. It is not only technologies that influence change in architecture; new business requirements and
