services, including: product lifecycle management (incrementally releasing new versions of a service), reliability, multilanguage communication support, observability, security, maintainability, and extensibility. A service mesh can help with all of these.    A service mesh can be implemented using language-specific libraries, sidecar proxies, proxyless communication frameworks (gRPC), or kernel-based technologies like eBPF.    The most vulnerable component of a service mesh is typically the control plane. This must be secured, monitored, and run as a highly available service.    Service mesh usage antipatterns include: service mesh as ESB, service mesh as gateway, and using too many networking layers.    Choosing to implement a service mesh, and selecting the technology to do so, are Type 1 decisions. Research, requirements analysis, and appropriate design must be conducted.    If you have decided to adopt the service mesh pattern we believe that it is typically best to adopt and standardize on an open source implementation or commercial solution rather than build your own.      Regardless of your decision to adopt a service mesh, it is important to consider both external and internal operations and security for your APIs. This is the focus of the next section of this book.      1 The Linkerd project emerged from Twitter’s Finagle technology that was built to provide a communication framework for developers building Twitter’s distributed applications.
