build and deployment pipelines allowed us to do continuous integration and deployment, and containers and associated technologies like orchestration let us run large numbers of small, independent services as a distributed system.  Why are we doing that? Because of the second thing: the research showing that successful software development organizations have loosely coupled architectures and autonomous, empowered teams. Successful here is defined in terms of a positive impact on the business: increased market share, productivity, and profitability.  Our architectures now tend to be more loosely coupled, distributed, and built around APIs. You want your APIs to be discoverable, consistent, and unlikely to cause problems to the consumers even if they change unexpectedly or disappear. Anything else will couple work together and slow down your teams.  In this book, James, Daniel and Matthew provide a comprehensive and practical guide to building effective API architectures. They cover a lot of ground, from how to build and test an individual API, through the ecosystem you deploy them into, the ways to release and operate them effectively, and perhaps most importantly, how to use APIs to evolve your architecture. Those first APIs I built at the Financial Times don’t exist anymore, and we built those systems again from scratch. That’s costly. James, Daniel, and Matthew provide a template for how to deal with inevitable change and evolve your systems, using APIs as a key tool.
