embrace the library-based approach to implementing a service mesh, you will need to be aware that you will have to build, maintain, and upgrade all of your libraries in lock-step in order to avoid compatibility issues or provide a suboptimal developer experience for some languages. You may also find subtle differences between implementations across language platforms, or bugs that only affect a specific runtime.      Sidecars   In the early 2010s, many engineers were embracing the approach to polyglot programming, and it was not uncommon for a single organization to have services written in multiple languages that were deployed to production. The desire to write or maintain one library that handled all of the required networking abstractions led to the creation of libraries that ran externally to a service as standalone processes. The microservice “sidecar” was born. In 2013, Airbnb wrote about “Synapse and Nerve,” its open source implementation of a service discovery sidecar. One year later, Netflix introduced Prana, a sidecar that exposed an HTTP interface for non-JVM applications to integrate with the rest of the Netflix OSS ecosystem for service discovery, circuit breaking, and more. The core concept here was that a service did not connect directly to its downstream dependencies, but instead all of the traffic went through the Prana sidecar that transparently added the desired networking abstraction and features.  As the use of the microservices architecture style
