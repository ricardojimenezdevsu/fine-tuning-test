common software development challenges, patterns, and best practices. You are increasingly realizing that the software industry’s march toward building service-oriented architecture (SOA) and adopting cloud services means that building and operating APIs is fast becoming a core skill. You are keen to learn more about designing effective APIs and testing them. You want to explore the various implementation choices (e.g., synchronous versus asynchronous communication) and technologies and learn how to ask the right questions and evaluate which approach is best for a given context.      Accidental Architect   You have most likely been developing software for many years and have often operated as a team lead or resident software architect (even if you don’t have the official titles). You understand core architectural concepts, such as designing for high cohesion and loose coupling, and apply these to all aspects of software development, including design, testing, and operating systems.  You realize that your role is increasingly focused on combining systems to meet customer requirements. This could include internally built applications and third-party SaaS-type offerings. APIs play a big part in successfully integrating your systems with external systems. You want to learn more about the supporting technologies (e.g., API gateway, service mesh, etc.) and also understand how to operate and secure API-based systems.      Solutions/Enterprise Architect   You have been designing and
