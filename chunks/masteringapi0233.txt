Gather the right information—Generate a high-level design of the system and ensure you have the right information. To be able to understand how your systems work and work together, this will include having the right people involved in the conversation.    Decompose the system—Break down your high-level design so that you can start to model the threats. This may require multiple models and diagrams.    Identify threats—Systematically look for threats to your systems.    Evaluate the risk of the threats—Prioritize threats to focus on the most likely ones, then identify mitigations to these likely threats.    Validate—Ask yourself and your team if the changes in place have been successful. Should you perform another review?
