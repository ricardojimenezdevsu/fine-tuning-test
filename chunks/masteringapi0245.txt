/beta/attendees endpoint is publicly exposed. This early version was exposed for some testing and then forgotten about. As there is no proper management over exposed assets, it is not noticed, but an attacker could try to call the endpoint. If all API traffic is managed through your gateway, you should have a registration within it to know what exists. You can also examine requests and look for anomalies of requests called to unexpected endpoints.  To counteract this problem, an API management or developer portal platform can be used to catalog and track all APIs deployed to production. Many API Management solutions include this functionality as standard, as it is seen as a vital component to manage the lifecycle of APIs.      Denial of service   Within the STRIDE methodology, the “D” is focused on denial of service (DoS). A DoS attack attempts to overwhelm a system or any of its defenses for malicious purposes. For example, a firewall that becomes overloaded may default to allowing all traffic, which enables an attacker to make malicious calls that previously would have been blocked. Or a bad actor may simply want to deny availability of a critical service, such as a voting website. By overloading the system with traffic, no legitimate requests can be made and no user can vote. The OWASP API Top 10 has a security issue that covers DoS extensively.  The Attendee API needs to meet your scalability demands, but it should also guard against becoming overloaded with traffic. To
