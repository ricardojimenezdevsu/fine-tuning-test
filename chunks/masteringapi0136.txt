to host the new services. An example of this using Ambassador Edge Stack Mappings is shown here:   --- apiVersion: getambassador.io/v3alpha1 kind: Mapping metadata: name: attendees-host spec: hostname: "attendees.conferencesystem.com" prefix: / service: attendees.nextgen:8080  Many modern API gateways will also support routing based on paths or query strings. Whatever your requirements, and whatever the limitations of your current infrastructure, you should be able to easily route to both your existing application and new services.      Avoid Routing on Request Payloads   Some API gateways will enable routing based on the payload or body of a request, but this should generally be avoided for two reasons. First, this often leaks highly coupled domain-specific information into the API gateway config (e.g., a payload often conforms to a schema/contract that may change in the application, which the gateway will now need to be synchronized with). And second, it can be computationally expensive (and time-consuming) to deserialize and parse a large payload in order to extract the required information for routing.      Deploying API Gateways: Understanding and Managing Failure   Regardless of the deployment pattern and number of gateways involved within a system, an API gateway is typically on the critical path of many, if not all, user requests entering into your system. An outage of a gateway deployed at the edge typically results in the unavailability of the entire system. And an
