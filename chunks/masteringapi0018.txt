the API invocation is in process or out of process. The process being referred to here is an operating system (OS) process. For example, a Java method invocation from one class to another is an in-process API invocation, as the call is handled by the same process from which the call was made. A .NET application invocating an external REST-like API using an HTTP library is an out-of-process API invocation, as the call is handled by an additional external process other than the process from which the call was made. Typically, an out-of-process API call will involve data traversing a network, potentially a local network, virtual private cloud (VPC) network, or the internet. We will focus on the latter style of APIs; however, architects will often encounter the requirement to remodel an in-process API to an out-of-process API. In order to demonstrate this concept (and others), we will create a running case study that will evolve throughout the book.      Running Example: Conference System Case Study   We have chosen to model a conference system for our case study because the domain is easily recognizable but also provides enough complexity for modeling an evolutionary architecture. Figure I-1 visualizes the conference system at the top level, allowing us to set the context of the architecture under discussion. The system is used by an external customer to create their attendee account, review the conference sessions available, and book their attendance.      Figure I-1. C4
