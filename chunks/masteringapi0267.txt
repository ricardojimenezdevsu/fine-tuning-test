authorization server for the authorization it has been granted.    The authorization server will issue an access token if the client has been authorized by the resource owner.    The client makes a request for the resource to the resource server, which in our case is the API. The request will send the access token as part of the request.    The resource server will return the resource if the access token is valid.      Figure 7-5. Abstract protocol flow      This abstract protocol about how OAuth2 grants should work highlights that the resource owner has control over their own resources. The client is requesting authorization from the resource owner—i.e., “can I (the application) access your resources on your behalf?” The way in which authorization is given is not important. What is essential is that the resource owner has the opportunity to grant or deny access. When requesting a resource from the resource server (i.e., calling the API), how the client obtained the access token does not matter. As long as the request contains a valid access token, the resource server will issue the resource. Each step is isolated and does not require information about the previous step. This is why there are different grants for different scenarios, as they have their own implementation to ensure that these steps are secure for that environment.      ADR Guideline: Should I Consider Using OAuth2?   It is important that you understand the reasons to adopt using OAuth2 and whether it is even
