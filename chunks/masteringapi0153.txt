Is Service Mesh?   Fundamentally, “service mesh” is a pattern for managing all service-to-service (or application-to-application) communication within a distributed software system. There is a lot of overlap between the service mesh and API gateway patterns, with the primary differences being twofold. First, service mesh implementations are optimized to handle service-to-service, or east–west, traffic within a cluster or data center. Second, following from this, the originator of the communication is typically a (somewhat) known internal service, rather than a user’s device or a system running external to your applications.      Service Mesh Is Not Mesh Networking   Service mesh is not to be confused with mesh networking, which is a lower-level networking topology. Mesh networking is becoming increasingly prevalent in the context of Internet of Things (IoT) and also for implementing mobile communication infrastructure in remote or challenging scenarios (such as disaster relief). Service mesh implementations build on top of existing networking protocols and topologies.    The service mesh pattern focuses on providing traffic management (routing), resilience, observability, and security for service-to-service communication. Don’t worry if you haven’t heard much about this pattern, as it was only in 2016 that the Buoyant team coined the term to explain the functionality of their Linkerd technology.1 This, in combination with the introduction of other related technologies like
