regularly verified in order to ensure that you are capturing what is expected.      Information disclosure   Information disclosure is the “I” in STRIDE, and this is focused on not exposing information that should only be used internally or kept secret. Two common antipatterns in this category of threat include excessive data exposure and improper assets management.      Excessive data exposure   The OWASP API Top 10 Excessive data exposure is focused on making sure data is not exposed inappropriately. As a hypothetical scenario, imagine the Attendee service holds PII such as a passport number. When designing your API, it is important to prevent the inappropriate exposure of this data. It is all too easy to make naive assumptions about how an API will be called, especially as a system evolves over time. APIs that were initially intended only for internal consumption can be exposed publicly (with good intentions), or a previous API that was only accessible to a trusted client application can be opened to public consumption.  If an API is called via a web application, it is easy to examine requests, responses, and corresponding payloads via the developer tools included within modern web browsers. For example, any user information request made to the Attendee API may accidentally return passport information:   { "values": [ { "id": "0", "name": "Danny B", "age": 65, "email", "danny.b@masteringapis.com", "passport": "Abc12408NJUILM" }, { "id": "1", "name": "Jimmy G", "age": 93,
