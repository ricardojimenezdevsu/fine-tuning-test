support. This is why your end-to-end testing needs to be representative of the way that a consumer uses your API.      Types of End-to-End Tests   The end-to-end tests that you write should be driven off the requirements that are most important, as you saw in “Test Quadrant”.  Within Q3 of the test quadrant, you see scenario testing. Scenario tests are a common form of end-to-end testing. They are for testing out typical user journeys and provide confidence that your service is performing correctly. A scenario test can be based around a single action or multiple actions. It is important that you are only testing core user journeys and not testing edge cases or exception testing. To help you write your tests, you can use Behavior Driven Development (BDD). This is a nice way to write your user stories as part of your business-facing tests. An example for the conference system would be that when an attendee is registered for a conference talk, the attendee count should have increased when the conference talk information is retrieved.  The nice thing with scenario tests and validating these core user journeys is that you are not going to be concerned if a component is slower than in production. What is being interrogated is the correct behavior and expected results. However, you need to be more careful when running performance end-to-end tests. Performance testing, Q4 in the testing quadrant, should be deployed to a like-for-like environment of your production environment. If the
