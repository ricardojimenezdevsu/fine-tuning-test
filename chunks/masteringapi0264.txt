The authority that issued the token. This is normally an identity provider (e.g., Google or Auth0).    sub (Subject)  A unique identifier to identify the principal of the JWT. In the case of the mobile application that is acting on behalf of the user, this would be attendee (e.g., Matthew Auburn); if this was a server-to-server connection, this may be the application (e.g., the CFP System).4 The subject value does not follow any format, and if you are defining what the subject should be, you must decide if it should be unique within your system or universally unique (e.g., using a UUID).    aud (Audience)  Who this token is intended for.    exp (Expiration time)  When the token expires (45 minutes after being issued in this case).    nbf (Not before)  Token should not be used before this time (same time as the issued time in this case).    iat (Issued at)  The time the token was issued.    jti (JWT ID)  A unique identifier for the JWT.      Note   Tokens can contain more information such as preferred name, email of the user, claims about the issuing party, and which application requested the token. For high-security APIs it is common that the authentication method to the authorization server is a claim, which can be used to check if MFA was used by the resource owner to authenticate themselves.      Encoding and verifying JSON Web Tokens   There are two popular encoding mechanisms for JWT, which have their own format:  JSON Web Signatures (JWS) provides integrity to a JWT.
