constraints also drive change in architectural direction.  The culminating effect of delivering incremental value combined with new emerging technologies leads to the concept of evolutionary architecture. Evolutionary architecture is an approach to incrementally changing an architecture, focusing on the ability to change with speed and reducing the risk of negative impacts. Along the way, we ask you to keep the following advice in approaching API architecture in mind:  Though architects like to be able to strategically plan for the future, the constantly changing software development ecosystem makes that difficult. Since we can’t avoid change, we need to exploit it.  Building Evolutionary Architectures by Neal Ford, Rebecca Parsons, and Patrick Kua (O’Reilly)    In many projects APIs themselves are evolutionary, requiring change as more systems and services are integrated. Most developers have built services that focus on a single function without considering the broader API reuse from a consumer perspective.  API-First design is an approach where developers and architects consider the functionality of their service and design an API in a consumer-centric manner. The API consumer could be a mobile application, another service, or even an external customer. In Chapter 1 we will review design techniques to support an API-First approach and discover how we build APIs that are durable to change and deliver value to a broad consumer base.  The good news is that you can start an
