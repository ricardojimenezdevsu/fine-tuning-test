cluster. Even in a relatively small environment with, say, 20 services, each running five pods spread across three nodes, you will have 100 proxy containers running. However small and efficient the proxy implementation is, the sheer duplication of the proxies will impact resources.  Depending on the service mesh configuration, the amount of memory used by each proxy may increase in relation to the number of services that it needs to be able to communicate with. Pranay Singhal wrote about his experiences configuring Istio to reduce consumption from around 1 GB per proxy to a much more reasonable 60–70 MB each. However, even in the small, imaginary environment with 100 proxies on three nodes, this optimized configuration still requires approximately 2 GB per node.      Proxyless gRPC libraries   In an evolution that appears we may have come full circle, the Google Cloud began promoting “proxyless gPRC” in early 2021, where the networking abstractions are once again moved back into a language-specific library (albeit a library maintained by Google and a large OSS community). These gRPC libraries are included within each service and act as the data plane within the service mesh. The libraries require access to an external control plane for coordination, such as the Google Traffic Director service. Traffic Director uses open source “xDS APIs” to configure the gRPC libraries within the applications directly.6 These gRPC applications act as xDS clients, connecting to Traffic
