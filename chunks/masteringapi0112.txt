consumption by aggregating/translating backend services    Protecting APIs from overuse and abuse with threat detection and mitigation    Understanding how APIs are being consumed (observability)    Managing APIs as products with API lifecycle management    Monetizing APIs by using account management, billing, and pay      Reduce Coupling: Adapter/Facade Between Frontends and Backends   Three fundamental concepts that every software architect should learn about early in their career are coupling, cohesion, and information hiding. You are taught that systems that are designed to exhibit loose coupling and high cohesion will be easier to understand, maintain, and modify. Information hiding is the principle of segregation of the design decisions in a software system that are most likely to change. Loose coupling allows different implementations to be swapped in easily, and can be especially useful when testing systems (e.g., it is easier to mock and stub loosely coupled dependencies). High cohesion promotes understandability—that is, all code in a module or system supports a central purpose—and reliability and reusability. Information hiding protects other parts of the system from extensive modification if the design decision is changed. In our experience, APIs are often the locations in a system in which the architectural theory meets the reality; an API is quite literally and figuratively an interface that other engineers integrate with.  An API gateway can act as a single
