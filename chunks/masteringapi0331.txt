to take advantage of cloud infrastructure), and retire.    When migrating an API application to the cloud, you will often find that the line between north–south (ingress) and east–west (service-to-service) traffic management blurs.    An API gateway can be used as a tool for migration, as it can encapsulate functionality and act as a facade for multiple backend systems operating from different environments and networks.    The industry is moving away from zonal network architectures to “zero trust” systems, and service mesh technology can facilitate this move.    Adopting zero trust allows you to combine both zero trust and zonal architectures, which helps with bridging cloud and on-premises systems during a migration period.      With your journey through the landscape of API architecture almost complete, the next and final chapter wraps up the key concepts and provides a look to the future in this space.      1 See “6 Strategies for Migrating Applications to the Cloud”.  2 Interested readers can learn more about zonal architectures from the Canadian government’s Network Security Zoning.  3 The mechanics of this varies for each service mesh implementation.      Chapter 10. Wrap-up   In the previous nine chapters of this book, you have undertaken a journey covering everything from designing APIs, to implementing, securing, and operating them. The focus has been on architecture, but just as important is how you apply architecture within your organization.  In this final
