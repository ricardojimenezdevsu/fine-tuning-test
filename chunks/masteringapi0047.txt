domain/industry-specific amendments.  Start with something early to avoid having to break compatibility later for consistency.  Be critical of existing APIs. Are they in a format that consumers would understand or is more effort required to offer the content?      Specifying REST APIs Using OpenAPI   As we’re beginning to see, the design of an API is fundamental to the success of an API platform. The next consideration we’ll discuss is sharing the API with developers consuming our APIs.  API marketplaces provide a public or private listing of APIs available to a consumer. A developer can browse documentation and quickly try out an API in the browser to explore the API behavior and functionality. Public and private API marketplaces have placed REST APIs prominently into the consumer space. The success of REST APIs has been driven by both the technical landscape and the low barrier to entry for both the client and server.  As the number of APIs grew, it quickly became necessary to have a mechanism to share the shape and structure of APIs with consumers. This is why the OpenAPI Initiative was formed by API industry leaders to construct the OpenAPI Specification (OAS). Swagger was the original reference implementation of the OpenAPI Specifications, but most tooling has now converged on using OpenAPI.  The OpenAPI Specifications are JSON- or YAML-based representations of the API that describe the structure, the domain objects exchanged, and any security requirements of the API. In
