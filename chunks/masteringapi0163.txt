Design and Deploy Production-Ready Software, now in its second edition, provides a comprehensive exploration and implementation guide. However, as you will explore in more depth in “Supporting Cross-Functional Communication Across Languages”, attempting to implement this functionality in code typically leads to inconsistent behavior, especially across different languages and platforms.  As a service mesh is involved with initiating and managing every service-to-service communication, it provides the perfect place to consistently implement these reliability patterns to provide fault-tolerance and graceful degradation. Depending on the implementation, a service mesh can also detect issues and share this information across the mesh, allowing each service within the mesh to make appropriate decisions on how to route traffic—e.g., if a service’s response latency is increasing, all services that call the target service can be instructed to instead initiate their fallback actions.  For the case study, a service mesh will enable you to define how to handle any failures when communicating with the new Session service. Imagine several thousand attendees at an event having just watched the morning conference keynote and wanting to view their schedule for the day. This sudden spike of traffic for the Session service may result in degraded behavior. For the majority of use cases you would define appropriate timeouts and retries, but you may also define a circuit-breaking action that
