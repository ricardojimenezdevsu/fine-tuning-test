provide insight into the limits, breaking points, and visible behavior.      Warning   It is important to understand if your API gateway and other edge security tools have “fail open” or “fail closed” polices. Fail open policies will continue to permit access to your services even if there are failure conditions. A hypothetical example is that in medical emergency services, it is more important to serve information about a patient’s medical history than to authenticate the request. A fail close policy is when connections will be blocked in failure conditions. There is no single correct implementation, and the default should meet your requirements. For example, the majority of financial APIs would want a fail closed policy by default, whereas a public weather service may implement a fail open policy.    For the case study, the most appropriate location to implement rate limiting would be the API gateway. To perform rate limiting, you will typically want to identify the originator of each request (or set of requests on aggregate). Example properties include IP address, geo-location, or a client ID that is sent by the client. You may not want to limit on an incoming property and instead treat all requests as being equal.  Once a request property has been selected (none, or otherwise), a strategy needs to be applied to perform the limiting. The most common examples include:  Fixed window  A fixed limit within a period, e.g., 2,400 requests per day.    Sliding window  A limit
