that is available to you and your organization.  Contracts can be stored alongside the producer code in version control (e.g., Git). They can also be published alongside your build into an artifact repository such as Artifactory.  Ultimately the contracts need to be obtainable by the producer and the consumer. The storage point also needs to allow for the submission of new contracts. The producer should have control over which contracts are accepted in the project and can ensure that undesired changes arenâ€™t made or additional contracts are added. The downside to this approach is that in a large organization it can be difficult to find all the API services that use contracts.  Another option is to store all the contracts in a centralized location to enable visibility into other API interactions that are available. This central location could be a Git repository, but the downside to this approach is that unless organized and set up correctly, it is possible and likely that contracts get pushed into a module that the producer has no intention of fulfilling.  Yet another option for storing contracts is to use a broker. The Pact contract framework has a broker product that can be used as a central location to host contracts. A broker can show all contracts that have been validated by the producer as the producer will publish those contracts that have been fulfilled. A broker can also see who is using a contract to produce a network diagram, integrate with CI/CD pipelines, and
