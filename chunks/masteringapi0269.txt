is a most well-known grant, and you will likely have used it without realizing you did.5 The typical use case for the Authorization Code Grant is a website backed by a server, which is not publicly available to the internet (i.e., it can protect a secret). A client application that can protect a secret is called a confidential client. Figure 7-6 describes in more detail how the grant works:  The client application directs the web browser (the User Agent in the diagram is a web browser) to an authorization server. The redirect to the authorization server will include the identification of the client (a client ID), and as part of the redirect it also has what grant is being used (in this case the Authorization Code Grant is known as code).    The authorization server asks the resource owner (end user) to identify themselves. The authorization server needs to know who the resource owner is, so the resource owner will need to authenticate to the authorization server. The authorization server is then able to get consent from the resource owner if they grant authorization to the client application. (Steps A and B of the Authorization Code Grant are all about the authorization request; this is shown as a single step (A) in the abstract protocol from Figure 7-5.)    Assuming authorization is granted, an authorization code is passed to the client application, via the User Agent. (This step matches to Step B of the abstract protocol where it shows the authorization grant returned.)
