Learning About Best Practices and Use Cases   We also recommend that you constantly be on the lookout for best practices and use cases related to the work you are doing. Many organizations like to share the why, what, and how of what they are doing. The motivations for this are important to understand, but often it’s a mix of altruism, bragging rights, sales awareness, and recruiting. You always have to apply caution when learning about use cases, as most of these do skew toward positive coverage, potentially skipping over the initial failed tries, things that went wrong, or things that are still going wrong. However, the context provided can enable you to pattern match problems and solutions onto your organization and team. Sometimes this can provide confirmation of your chosen technology stack or approach, and on other occasions this can cause you to rethink!  Use cases and best practices can often be found in written and presentation format. Generally we recommend looking for both, and the advantage of conference presentations is that you can chat with the presenters after the talk in order to learn more! Following is a list of conferences that we regularly attend:  QCon conference series    CraftConf    APIDays (API-focused)    KubeCon (platform-specific)    Devoxx / JavaOne (language-specific)    O’Reilly online events      Learning by Doing   We believe that architects should remain as practicing software engineers.
