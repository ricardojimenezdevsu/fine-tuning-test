machine-to-machine communication, the connection is set up in advance and the access (what the client is authorized to do) should be pre-arranged.  The process of the client obtaining an access token is very straightforward as shown in Figure 7-9:6  The client application authenticates to the authorization server and requests an access token. The client also identifies the grant being used, which is client_credentials.    The authorization server returns an access token if the client application successfully authenticates.      Figure 7-9. Client Credentials Grant      There are no additional steps as there is no resource owner to give permission. The client is acting on its own behalf so only is required to identify itself.      Case Study: Accessing Attendee API from the CFP system with Client Credentials Grant   The External CFP system produces a report every three months to show how many attendees go on to submit talks and become speakers. This report generation is not on behalf of an attendee but instead happens for the External CFP system. The client (External CFP system) is registered into the authorization server.7 In the Attendee service the client is added into a list of clients that can access the service and is configured to be able to read information about attendees and query which users have submitted talksâ€”this is the pre-arranged access. When the client wants to access the Attendee API, it will request an access token from the authorization server and then
