container, along with the internal interactions. This diagram is useful if the detail of a container is queried, and it also provides a very useful map to the codebase. Think about the first time starting work on a new project: browsing a self-documenting codebase is one approach—but it can be difficult to piece everything together. A component diagram reveals the detail of the language/stack you are using to build your software. In order to remain technology agnostic, we have used the term package/module.      Using Architecture Decision Records   As developers, architects, and indeed humans, we have all been in the position where we ask the question “what were they thinking??” If you have ever driven on the M62 between Leeds and Manchester in the United Kingdom, you may have been baffled by the construction of the motorway. As you climb the hill on the three-lane highway, it starts to deviate away from the traffic contraflow, until eventually Scott Hall Farm emerges surrounded by around 15 acres of farming land nestled between the carriages. Local legend of what happened described the owner of the land as stubborn and refusing to move or hand over his land, so the engineers simply built around him.2 Fifty years later a documentary surfaced revealing that the real reason for this was a geological fault beneath the land, meaning the motorway had to be built that way. When people guess why something was done in a particular way, expect rumor, humor, and criticism to emerge.
