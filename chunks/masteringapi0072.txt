ticket system is resilient (e.g., performance testing). This would be part of Q4.      Test Pyramid   In addition to the test quadrants, the test pyramid (also known as the test automation pyramid) can be used as part of your strategy for test automation. The test pyramid was first introduced in the book Succeeding with Agile by Mike Cohn. This pyramid illustrates a notion of how much time should be spent on a given test area, its corresponding difficulty to maintain, and the value it provides in terms of additional confidence. The test pyramid at its core has remained unchanged. It has unit tests as its foundation, service tests in the middle block, and UI tests at the peak of the pyramid. Figure 2-3 shows the areas of the test pyramid you will explore.      Figure 2-3. The test pyramid, showing the proportion of tests desired      The test automation pyramid shows the trade-offs that exist in terms of confidence, isolation, and scope. By testing small parts of the codebase, you have better isolation and faster tests; however, this does not give confidence that the whole application is working. By testing the entire application in its ecosystem, the opposite is true. The tests give you more confidence that the application is working, but the scope of the test will be large as many pieces will be interacting together. This also makes it more difficult to maintain and slow. The following defines each of the core elements of the test pyramid:  Unit tests are at the bottom of
