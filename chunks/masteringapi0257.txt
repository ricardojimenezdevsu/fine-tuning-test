Attendee API is ready to receive traffic from the outside world; however, how exactly is the consumer of the API identified? In this chapter we are going to explore authentication and authorization for APIs. Authentication tells us who the callee is and authorization tells us what they are allowed to do.  We will begin by highlighting what authentication and authorization is for APIs. This leads to the importance of securing APIs and the potential limitations with using API keys and tokens. OAuth2 is a token-based authorization framework introduced in 2012 and has rapidly become the industry standard for securing APIs and determining what actions an application can perform against an API. A large part of this chapter will focus on OAuth2 and the range of security approaches offered for both end users and system-based interactions. Consumers of APIs will sometimes need to know details of the user they are acting on behalf ofâ€”to show how this can be achieved we will introduce OIDC.  The chapter will illustrate the different approaches to security by looking to prepare the Attendee API for external usage by the CFP system.      Authentication   Authentication is the act of verifying an identity. For the case of a user, the most traditional method is that the user presents their credentials in the form of a username and the password. It is now becoming more common for Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to be part of a standard login flow. MFA is useful to give higher levels of
