with are VirtualServices and DestinationRules.8 A VirtualService defines a set of traffic routing rules to apply when a host is addressedâ€”e.g., http://sessions. A DestinationRule defines policies that apply to traffic intended for a service after routing has occurred. These rules specify configuration for load balancing, connection pool size from the sidecar, and outlier detection settings to detect and evict unhealthy hosts from the load balancing pool.  For example, to enable routing to your Session and Attendee services within the case study, you can create the following VirtualServices:   --- apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3 kind: VirtualService metadata: name: sessions spec: hosts: - sessions http: - route: - destination: host: sessions subset: v1 --- apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3 kind: VirtualService metadata: name: attendees spec: hosts: - attendees http: - route: - destination: host: attendees subset: v1  The following DestinationRules can also be created. Note how the attendees DestinationRule specifies two versions of the service; this is the foundation for enabling canary routing for the new v2 version of the service:   --- apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3 kind: DestinationRule metadata: name: sessions spec: host: sessions subsets: - name: v1 labels: version: v1 --- apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3 kind: DestinationRule metadata: name: attendees spec: host: attendees subsets: - name: v1 labels: version: v1 - name: v2 labels:
