building enterprise software systems for several years and most likely have the word architect in your job title or role description. You are responsible for the big picture of software delivery and typically work within the context of a large organization or a series of large interconnected organizations.  You recognize the changes that the latest iteration of service-based architectural styles are having on the design, integration, and governance of software, and you see APIs are pivotal to the success of your organization’s software strategy. You are keen to learn more about evolutionary patterns and understand how the choice of API design and implementation will impact this. You also want to focus on the cross-functional “ilities”—usability, maintainability, scalability, and availability—and understand how to build API-based systems that exhibit such properties, as well as provide security.      What You Will Learn   After reading this book you will understand:  The fundamentals of REST APIs and how to best build, version, and test APIs    The architectural patterns involved in building an API platform    The differences in managing API traffic at ingress and within service-to-service communication, and how to apply patterns and technologies such as API gateways and service meshes    Threat modeling and key security considerations for APIs, such as authentication, authorization, and encryption    How to evolve existing systems toward APIs and different target deployments,
