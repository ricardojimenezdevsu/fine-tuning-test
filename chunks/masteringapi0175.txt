Some smaller organizations took on the burden themselves of writing the required networking libraries and tools, but the cost was typically high, especially in the long term. Sometimes this cost was explicit and clearly visibleâ€”for example, the cost of engineers assigned to teams dedicated to building tooling. But more often the true expense was difficult to fully quantify as it manifests itself as time taken for new developers to learn proprietary solutions, resources required for operational maintenance, or other forms of taking time and energy away from working on your customer-facing products.  Phil also observed that the use of libraries that expose functionality via language bindings or an SDK limited the tools, runtimes, and languages you can use for your microservices. Libraries for microservices are often written for a specific platform, be it a programming language or a runtime like the JVM. If you use platforms other than the one supported by the library, you will most likely need to port the code to the new platform itself, with your costs increasing in relation to the number of languages.      Service Mesh Libraries and the Price of Polyglot   Many organizations embrace a polyglot approach to coding applications and use a variety of languages, choosing the most appropriate one for a service in order to accomplish the requirements. For example, using Java for long-running business services, Go for infrastructure services, and Python for data science work. If you
