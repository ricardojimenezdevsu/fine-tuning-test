completed the security objectives that you set out at the beginning of the threat modeling exercise. Threat modeling should be a recursive process with each run through the process identifying previously unknown issues. You should also periodically and continually run the threat modeling process, especially when adding new functionality to the system, but also as the external threat environment continually evolves.  Threat modeling is a skill and it takes time to learn the process itself, and it is also time-consuming. However, as with any skill, the more it is used and integrated into your regular workflow, the easier it gets.      Summary   In this chapter you have learned how to conduct a threat modeling exercise, both against the case study and also how to apply it to your own systems and APIs:  There are strong financial penalties and reputational damage for failing to secure APIs.    Threat modeling of an API-based system typically begins by creating a data flow diagram (DFD). Automated tooling can be used in order to rapidly analyze and identify potential threats.    You don’t need to be a security expert to conduct threat modeling, and a key skill is “thinking like an attacker.”    The process of threat modeling includes: identifying your objectives, gathering the right information, decomposing the system, identifying threats, evaluating the risk of those threats, and validating the results and actions.
