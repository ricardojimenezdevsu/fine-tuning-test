uses Mutual TLS instead of secret strings to obtain access tokens.  7 It is fine to have a client registered for multiple grant types; the subject of the callee will be different depending on the grant used. As we see here in the client credentials, the subject is the client making the request and not on behalf of a resource owner.  8 This may be an array—comma-separated, or like this case, space separated.      Part IV. Evolutionary Architecture with APIs   This section explores how to evolve the architecture of a system or series of systems using APIs. This includes evolving existing legacy applications toward API-based, service-oriented architectures, and also using API infrastructure for evolving or replatforming a system for effective deployment into a cloud environment.  Chapter 8 explores redesigning monolithic applications toward an API-driven architecture.  In Chapter 9, you will learn how to use API infrastructure to evolve your current systems toward cloud platforms.  Chapter 10 provides a summary of key lessons you have learned throughout the book. This chapter also presents ways in which you can continue to evolve the case study and advance your learning about API architecture.      Chapter 8. Redesigning Applications to API-Driven Architectures   Now that you have a solid grasp of API operations and security, you will explore how APIs can be used to evolve and augment existing applications. In Building Evolutionary Architectures (O’Reilly), the authors discuss
