or commercial solution rather than build your own. Presenting the case for build versus buy with software delivery technology could take an entire book, and so in this section we only want to highlight some common challenges:  Underestimating the total cost of ownership (TCO)  Many engineers discount the cost of engineering a solution, the continued maintenance costs, and the ongoing operational costs.    Not thinking about opportunity cost  Unless you are a cloud or platform vendor, it is highly unlikely that a custom service mesh will provide you with a competitive advantage. You can instead deliver more value to your customers by building functionality aligned to your core value proposition.    Operational costs  Not understanding the onboarding and operational cost of maintaining multiple different implementations that solve the same problems.    Awareness of technical solutions  Both the open source and commercial platform component space move fast, and it can be challenging to keep up-to-date. Staying aware and informed, however, is a core part of the role of being a technical leader.      Checklist: Selecting a Service Mesh   The checklist in Table 4-5 highlights the key decisions that you and your team should be considering when deciding whether to implement the service mesh pattern and when choosing the related technologies.
