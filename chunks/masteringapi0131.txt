registers/updates gateway via admin API (in mature organizations this is achieved through delivery pipelines).  Service team registers/updates gateway via declarative code as part of the deployment process.  Service team registers/updates mesh and gateway via declarative code as part of the deployment process.    Monitoring  Admin and operations focused, e.g., meter API calls per consumer, report errors (e.g., internal 5XX).  Developer focused, e.g., latency, traffic, errors, saturation.  Platform focused, e.g., utilization, saturation, errors.    Handling and Debugging Issues  L7 error-handling (e.g., custom error page). For troubleshooting, run gateway/API with additional logging and debug issue in staging environment.  L7 error-handling (e.g., custom error page, failover, or payload). For debugging issues configure more detailed monitoring, and enable traffic shadowing and/or canarying to re-create the problem.  L7 error-handling (e.g., custom error page or payload). For troubleshooting, configure more detailed monitoring and/or utilize traffic “tapping” to view and debug specific service-to-service communication.    Testing  Operate multiple environments for QA, staging, and production. Automated integration testing, and gated API deployment. Use consumer-driven API versioning for compatibility and stability (e.g., semver).  Enables canary routing and dark launching for dynamic testing. Use contract testing for upgrade management.  Facilitate canary routing for dynamic
