into detail about securing north–south API traffic.      East–west traffic   The new interaction between the legacy conference system and the Attendee service introduces an east–west traffic flow to our system. East–west traffic can be thought of as service-to-service style of communication within a group of applications. Most east–west traffic, particularly if the origin is within your wider infrastructure, can be trusted to some degree. Although we can trust the source of the traffic, it is still necessary to consider securing east–west traffic.      API Infrastructure and Traffic Patterns   There are two key infrastructure components present in API-based architectures, which are key to controlling traffic. Controlling and coordinating traffic is often described as traffic management. Generally north–south traffic will be controlled by API gateways, the key subject for Chapter 3.  East–west traffic will often be handled by infrastructure components like Kubernetes or service mesh, the key subject for Chapter 4. Infrastructure components like Kubernetes and service mesh use network abstractions to route to services, requiring services to run inside a managed environment. In some systems east–west traffic is managed by the application itself and service discovery techniques are implemented to locate other systems.
