Diagnostics are more concerned with failures in the processing and any unexpected errors outside of a journal-based event. As part of the structured log, you can add a field to represent the log type, allowing quick access to either only journals or full diagnostics.

For opinionated platforms to be successful, they need to enhance the path to production, taking into account DevOps and other key factors required to operate on the platform. This is often referred to as the paved path or golden path to production.
