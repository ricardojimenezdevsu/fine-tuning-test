processes that must be tested regularly. This is especially important if the API gateway instances run in active/passive or leader/node modes of operation.  You must ensure that your load balancer to API gateway failover process meets all of your requirements in relation to continuity of service. Common problems experienced during failover events include:  User client state management issues, such as backend state not being migrated correctly, which causes the failure of sticky sessions    Poor performance, as clients are not redirected based on geographical considerations (e.g., European users being redirected to the US west coast when an east coast data center is available)    Unintentional cascading failure, such as a faulty leader election component that results in deadlock, which causes all backend systems to become unavailable      Common API Gateway Implementation Pitfalls   You’ve already seen that no technology is a silver bullet, but, continuing on the theme of technology cliches, it can be the case that when you have a technology hammer, everything tends to look like a nail. This can be the case with an API gateway “hammer,” and there are several common API gateway pitfalls or antipatterns that you should always aim to avoid.      API Gateway Loopback   As with all common pitfalls, the implementation of this pattern often begins with good intentions. When an organization has only a few services, this typically doesn’t warrant the installation of a service mesh.
