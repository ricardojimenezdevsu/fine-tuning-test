fundamental components: a control plane and data plane. These components can typically be packaged together or deployed separately. The control plane is where operators interact with the gateway and define routes, policies, and required telemetry. The data plane is the location where all of the work specified in the control plane occurs, the network packets are routed, the policies enforced, and telemetry emitted.      What Functionality Does an API Gateway Provide?   At a network level an API gateway typically acts as a reverse proxy to accept all of the API requests from a consumer, calls and aggregates the various application-level backend services (and potentially external services) required to fulfill them, and returns the appropriate result.      What Is a Proxy, Forward Proxy, and Reverse Proxy?   A proxy server, sometimes referred to as a forward proxy, is an intermediary server that forwards requests for content from multiple clients to different servers across the internet. A forward proxy is used to protect clients. For instance, a business may have a proxy that routes and filters employee traffic to the public internet. A reverse proxy server, on the other hand, is a type of proxy server that typically sits behind the firewall in a private network and routes client requests to the appropriate backend server. A reverse proxy is designed to protect servers.      An API gateway provides cross-cutting requirements such as user authentication, request rate limiting,
