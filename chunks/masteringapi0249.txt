assigned, or within denial of service and a rate-limiting policy is incorrectly set to fail open. Security misconfiguration is focused on ensuring that the security that you have in place is not incorrectly configured, and it is another piece that you must think about when evaluating each element of STRIDE for threats. It is a truism that having misconfigured security can be worse than having no security at all, as users behave very differently when they believe their actions and data are not secure. There are certain features of security that you are most likely always going to want, such as Transport Layer Security (TLS), and others that may be bespoke to an API or a setup, such as IP allowlisting.11  Within our case study, the API gateway is a key place where security misconfiguration could have a disastrous effect. Extra attention must be paid to its configuration as the API gateway is acting as the “front door.”      TLS termination   TLS will ensure that the traffic that you receive has not been intercepted and modified. Also, TLS certificates provide information about the owner of a domain, so you can be confident in who you are contacting. As the API gateway deals with all incoming traffic, TLS can be enabled here. Having a centralized location to manage the external TLS certificates for incoming requests is also convenient. This, in comparison to not using a gateway, where TLS certificates need to be added to each web server, proxy, and application that is handling
