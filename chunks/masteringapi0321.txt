are carefully designed and modeled as APIs. This was a concept that we explored in Chapter 1. By following good design principles and striving for “API-First” design, this enables you to unlock value both externally to customers or internally within the wider organization by using tools like API management.  To modernize and migrate applications to be able to take advantage of using a tool like external API management, you need to reconsider traffic patterns. As architecture evolves to become hybrid, spanning different networks and deployments, thoughts about traffic also needs to be challenged.      North–South Versus East–West: Blurring Lines of Traffic Management   With a tour of the various options available for an API infrastructure migration complete, let’s now explore how our chosen approach to replatforming will impact the management of API traffic within the evolving conference system. As we have chosen to incrementally migrate our services—rather than risk a big bang—the running of services across multiple cloud environments and on-premise data centers does present additional challenges. As is the case with many incremental cloud migrations, traffic will need to transit multiple networks in order to satisfy an API request made by a user.      Start at the Edge and Work Inward   In our case study, we have chosen to start at the edge by migrating the API gateway to the cloud along with a single service. Doing this can provide a migration team the chance to initially
