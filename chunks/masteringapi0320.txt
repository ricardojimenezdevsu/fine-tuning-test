additional features for publishing and controlling APIs. API managers provide policies that enable edge concerns, such as OAuth2 challenges, content validation, rate limiting, throttling, and many other features that are typical in a gateway. Additionally, they can provide developer portals containing a marketplace of all APIs that developers can use when building systems to consume offered APIs. Organizations can also use API management to monetize accessing APIs, both to external customers and for internal “chargebacks,” which are common in enterprises and cross-divisional deployments. In “Current API Gateway Taxonomy”, we shared taxonomies for API gateways, and API management sits within the enterprise gateway category.  Perhaps the most important part of API management is that it can offer a central point to discover APIs, while you continue to make changes behind the scenes. It is possible to front the legacy conference system with an API, for example, while also offering the new broken-out Attendee API. In the case of the conference organizers, they could potentially look at offering an API that provides “conference management as a service” that would allow other conferences to use this, or to interface in a controlled manner with the external CFP system. Assuming that contracts on the API don’t change, it is possible to evolve behind an API management layer.  Organizations often talk about the concept of being API First, meaning that all interactions between systems
