understand the threats you can expect.    The STRIDE methodology focuses your action on the threats of spoofing, tampering, repudiation, information disclosure, denial of service, and elevation of privilege.    The DREAD methodology can be used to calculate a qualitative risk metric that can help you prioritize which threats to mitigate first.    Within an API-based system, an API gateway can often provide high-level mitigation to risks that have been identified. However, as systems become more distributed, you should always consider individual service implementations and interservice communication.      You have seen a variety of threats that exist and ways to mitigate them. However, when you are returning data to the API consumer, you want to ensure that they are who they say they are, and the API consumer can only perform actions that they have permissions for. To see how you identify who the callee is and what they can do, you will take a deeper dive into authentication and authorization in the next chapter.      1 Ideally security should “start left” to bring security in as a foundation.  2 For an exhaustive reference and description of ways to perform threat modeling, please refer to Threat Modeling by Izar Tarandach and Matthew J. Coles (O’Reilly).  3 Individuals like Edward Snowden and TV shows like Mr. Robot have increased security conversations in the general public.  4 For a full breakdown of DFDs, visit the OWASP DFD introduction page.  5 You can find the
