Gateway   Table 3-4 provides a series of key ADR Guidelines that can be used to help you decide which API gateway to implement within your current organization or project.  Table 3-4. ADR Guideline: Selecting an API gateway checklist Decision  How should we approach selecting an API gateway for our organization?    Discussion Points  Have we identified and prioritized all of our requirements associated with selecting an API gateway?  Have we identified current technology solutions that have been deployed in this space within the organization?  Do we know all of our team and organizational constraints?  Have we explored our future roadmap in relation to this decision?  Have we honestly calculated the “build versus buy” costs?  Have we explored the current technology landscape and are we aware of all of the available solutions?  Have we consulted and informed all involved stakeholders in our analysis and decision making?    Recommendations  Focus particularly on your requirement to reduce API/system coupling, simplify consumption, protect APIs from overuse and abuse, understand how APIs are being consumed, manage APIs as products, and monetize APIs.  Key questions to ask include: is there an existing API gateway in use? Has a collection of technologies been assembled to provide similar functionality (e.g., hardware load balancer combined with a monolithic app that performs authentication and application-level routing)? How many components currently make up your edge stack
