outage of a gateway deployed further upstream typically results in the unavailability of some core subsystem. For this reason the topics of understanding and managing failure of an API gateway are vitally important to learn.      API Gateway as a Single Point of Failure   In a standard web-based system, the first obvious single point of failure is typically DNS. Although this is often externally managed, there is no escaping the fact that if this fails, then your site will be unavailable. The next single points of failure will typically then be the global and regional layer 4 load balancers, and depending on the deployment location and configuration, the security edge components, such as the firewall or WAF.  After these core edge components, the next layer is typically the API gateway. The more functionality you are relying on within the gateway, the bigger the risk involved and the bigger the impact of an outage. As an API gateway is often involved in a software release, the configuration is also continually being updated. It is critical to be able to detect and resolve issues and mitigate any risks.      Challenge Assumptions with Security Single Points of Failure   Depending on the product, deployment, and configuration, some security components may “fail open,” i.e., if the component fails then traffic will simply be passed through to upstream components or the backend. For some scenarios where availability is the most important goal, this is desired, but for others
