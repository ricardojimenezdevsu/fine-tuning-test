and how to move the Attendee service to the cloud and consider replatforming.      The case study and the planned roadmap require us to visualize architectural change and record decisions. These are important artifacts that help to explain and plan changes in software projects. We believe that C4 diagrams and Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) represent a clear way of recording change.      Using C4 Diagrams   As part of introducing the case study, we revealed three types of C4 diagrams from the C4 model. We believe C4 is the best documentation standard for communicating architecture, context, and interactions to a diverse set of stakeholders. You may be wondering what about UML? The Unified Modeling Language (UML) provides an extensive dialect for communicating software architectures. A major challenge is that the majority of what UML provides is not committed to memory by architects and developers, and people quickly revert to boxes/circles/diamonds. It becomes a real challenge to understand the structure of diagrams before getting into the technical content of the discussion. Many diagrams are only committed to a project history if someone accidentally uses a permanent marker instead of dry wipe marker by mistake. The C4 model provides a simplified set of diagrams that act as a guide to your project architecture at various levels of detail.      C4 Context Diagram   Figure I-1 is represented using a C4 context diagram from the C4 model. The intention of this diagram is
