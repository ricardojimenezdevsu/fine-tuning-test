STRIDE   The fourth step of threat modeling is all about looking at the threats to the system. When you start looking at the data flow diagram, it is important to keep your threat modeling objectives in mind, otherwise it can be tempting to go off on a tangent.  The benefit of using the dedicated Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool is that it can conduct some automated analysis for you using the STRIDE methodology. The generated list is not complete, but it can be used as a starting point. The list of generated threats for our Attendee API System is seen in Figure 6-3. In this case the tooling has found 27 potential threats.      Figure 6-3. Data flow diagram threat analysis      The STRIDE acronym stands for:6  Spoofing  Breaching the user’s authentication information. In this case, the hacker has obtained the user’s personal information or something that enables him to replay the authentication procedure. Spoofing threats are associated with a wily hacker being able to impersonate a valid system user or resource to get access to the system and thereby compromise system security.    Tampering  Modifying system or user data with or without detection. An unauthorized change to stored or in-transit information, formatting of a hard disk, a malicious intruder introducing an undetectable network packet in a communication, and making an undetectable change to a sensitive file are all tampering threats.    Repudiation  An untrusted user performing an illegal operation without the
