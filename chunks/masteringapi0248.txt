within the last period, e.g., 100 requests within the last hour.    Token bucket  A set number of total requests are allowed (bucket of tokens) and each request takes a token when a request is made. The bucket is refilled periodically.    Leaky bucket  Like the Token bucket, however, the rate at which requests are processed is a fixed rate; this is the leak of the bucket.      You can see rate limiting enforcement in Figure 6-4.      Figure 6-4. Rate limiting example with the API gateway      An example of load shedding is shown in Figure 6-5.      Figure 6-5. Load shedding example with the API gateway      Elevation of Privilege   The final letter “E” in STRIDE is focused on “Elevation of Privilege.” This occurs when a user or application finds a way to perform a task that is outside the scope of what should be allowed given the current security context—e.g., a user is able to execute tasks that are only meant to be executed by an administrator. The two OWASP Security Top 10 that relate to this are:  Broken Object Level Authorization    Broken Function Level Authorization      These are both focused on enforcing authorization and ensuring that requests to your API are entitled to perform the operation. This was covered in “Authorization Enforcement”.      Security misconfiguration   Security misconfiguration is not limited to one of these STRIDE categories, as misconfiguration can happen in a range of places, such as information disclosure, where a permission is incorrectly
