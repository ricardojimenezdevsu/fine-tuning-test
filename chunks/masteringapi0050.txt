architecture is common, with a notion of a demilitarized zone (DMZ) used to shield a network from inbound traffic. A useful feature is to interrogate messages in the DMZ and terminate the traffic if the specification does not match. We will cover security in more detail in Chapter 6.  Atlassian, for example, open sourced a tool called the swagger-request-validator, which is capable of validating JSON REST content. The project also has adapters that integrate with various mocking and testing frameworks to help ensure that API Specifications are conformed to as part of testing. The tool has an OpenApiInteractionValidator, which is used to create a ValidationReport on an exchange. The following code demonstrates building a validator from the specification, including any basePathOverridesâ€”which may be necessary if deploying an API behind infrastructure that alters the path. The validation report is generated from analyzing the request and response at the point where validation is executed:   //Using the location of the specification create an interaction validator //The base path override is useful if the validator will be used //behind a gateway/proxy final OpenApiInteractionValidator validator = OpenApiInteractionValidator .createForSpecificationUrl(specUrl) .withBasePathOverride(basePathOverride) .build; //Requests and Response objects can be converted or created using a builder final ValidationReport report = validator.validate(request, response); if (report.hasErrors()) { //
