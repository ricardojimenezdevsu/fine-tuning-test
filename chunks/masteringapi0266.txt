been modified or tampered with. Then other claims in the token should be validated, such as checking that the token has not expired (exp claim) or that the token is not used before it is allowed (nbf claim). All tokens that are issued should be short-lived; long-lived tokens are a risk if they are lost or stolen. On the topic of long-lived assertions, the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) Digital Guidelines state:  Long-lived assertions have a greater risk of being stolen or replayed; a short assertion lifetime mitigates this risk.    There is no official standard for how long a short-lived or long-lived token should be valid for. The typical suggested lifetime of a short-lived token is between 1 and 60 minutes, and a long-lived token is from one year to ten years. It is suggested that you keep the lifetime of tokens as short as possible.  There are many positives to using JWTs for an access token. Now letâ€™s look at their usage within OAuth2.      Terminology and Mechanisms of OAuth2 Grants   OAuth2 is designed to be extensible. The official OAuth2 spec was released in 2012 with four grants, and since then additional grants and modifications have been approved to extend its usage. This is made possible as OAuth2 presents an abstract protocol, shown in Figure 7-5:  The client requests authorization from the resource owner.    The resource owner will grant or deny the client access to their resources.    The client will ask for an access token from the
