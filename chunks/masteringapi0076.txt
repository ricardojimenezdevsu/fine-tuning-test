test pyramid will help you build a great API.  We do recognize that using the test quadrant in its truest form by having someone readily available from the business to help guide your testing is not always possible. However, at a minimum, use the test pyramid as this concentrates the automated side of the test quadrant. This at the very least will ensure that you find bugs early in your development cycle.  Whatever the case, you will always need someone to help guide the product direction.      Contract Testing   Contract testing has two entities: a consumer and a producer. A consumer requests data from an API (e.g., web client, terminal shell), and a producer (also known as a provider) responds to the API requests, i.e., it is producing data, such as a RESTful web service. A contract is a definition of an interaction between the consumer and producer. It is a statement to say if a consumer makes a request that matches the contract request definition, then the producer will return a response that matches the contract response definition. In the case of the Attendee API, it is a producer and the consumer is the legacy conference system. The legacy conference system is a consumer as it is calling the Attendee API.7 So why use contracts? What do they offer you?      Why Contract Testing Is Often Preferable   As you learned in “Specifying REST APIs Using OpenAPI”, APIs should have a specification, and it is important that your API responses conform to the API specification that
