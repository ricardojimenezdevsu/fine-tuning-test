to consult these.    One key factor when considering moving applications to the cloud is the introduction of latency between two services during evolutionary steps. If you have a high-traffic service, a slowdown will be incurred for each request when crossing network boundaries. Ensuring that there is an understanding of what the degradation looks like is an important consideration, and if this violates an SLA, moving the service may not be an option. In “Modeling Exchanges and Choosing an API Format”, you learned how to choose a protocol and design an API within constraints, which is an important consideration when crossing boundaries.  Retaining would not be a viable strategy for our conference use case, as this would simply be “kicking the can down the road” and deferring the goal of migrating to the cloud.      Rehost   “Rehost” is otherwise known as “lift-and-shift.” It involves moving systems and workloads to a cloud platform without any re-architecting. If you are looking to consolidate workloads or simply have to migrate away from your current infrastructure, this can often be an effective strategy. However, be aware that cloud infrastructure does not always behave in the same way as on-premise hardware, and so identify and confirm any assumptions that you have made.      Be Cautious with Specialist Systems and Bespoke Hardware   Although many “lift-and-shift” projects work as expected, some don’t. This is especially true in relation to specialist bespoke systems and
