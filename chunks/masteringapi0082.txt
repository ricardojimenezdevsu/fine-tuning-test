have this as a PATCH request.  This is where a good part of the value of contracts comes from: this discussion for both parties about what the problem is, and using a contract to assert that this is what the two parties accept and agree to. Once the contract is agreed to, the producer (Attendee service) accepts the contract as part of the project and can start fulfilling it.      Contracts methodology overview   These methodologies should hopefully give an overview of how to use contracts as part of the development process. This should not be taken as gospel, as variations do exist on the exact steps. For example, one process may request that the consumer—when writing the contract—also creates a basic implementation of producer code to fulfill the contract. In another example, the consumer should TDD the functionality they require and then create the contract before submitting the pull request. The exact process that is put in place may vary by team. Once you understand the core concepts and patterns of CDC, the exact process that is used is just an implementation detail.  If you are starting out on a journey to add contracts, you should note that there is a cost—the setup time to incorporate contracts into a project and also the cost of writing the contracts. It is worth looking at tooling that can create contracts for you based on an OpenAPI Specification.9      Contract testing frameworks   It is likely that when it comes to contract testing frameworks for HTTP, you will
