the right choice for you. To help with this decision, use this ADR Guideline (see Table 7-1) to help you determine what is right for you and the conversations you may want to have.  Table 7-1. ADR Guideline: Do I need to use OAuth2? Decision  Should OAuth2 be used or is there another standard for authentication and authorization that is preferred for the operating environment?    Discussion Points  When you start working with APIs, you have the opportunity to decide or influence the security mechanisms for them:  Examine the current security requirements and how things might potentially change. For example, are APIs just used within a control plane or are they also used outside of a control plane/potentially with third parties?    What security model are you expected to support? Have external integrators requested that you use a certain security model?    Do you need to support multiple authentication and authorization models? This is important if you are looking to migrate from an existing authentication model to another.      Recommendations  Using OAuth2 will provide the maximum compatibility with other API users. It is an industry standard with documentation and client libraries that ease integration. OAuth2 supports both the end user and system-to-system cases.      Authorization Code Grant   The Authorization Code Grant (Auth Code Grant) is an implementation of an OAuth2 grant; it is an implementation of the abstract protocol that you saw previously in Figure 7-5.
