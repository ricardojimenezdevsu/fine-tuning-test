“From Zonal Architecture to Zero Trust”.  Your case study security goals are quite specific: the Attendee API should be prepared for external consumption, and to achieve this we will ensure that each process mitigates the OWASP API Security Top 10 issues. As this is a direct objective, the DFD can be used to map data flows to the issues and vulnerabilities listed on the OWASP site. However, typically a threat modeling objective may be something like “Prevent data leakage of PII to conform with GDPR,” or “Provide 99.9% availability for APIs to fulfill contractual obligations.” This second objective may not appear to be related to security, however you will want to keep DoS at the forefront of your mind, as not fulfilling this obligation, even when under a DoS attack, could result in a financial penalty.  Let’s now review the system and apply STRIDE. To highlight the OWASP API Security Top 10, the threats will be grouped under the applicable STRIDE value. This is to showcase both the application of STRIDE and the OWASP API Security Top 10 along with their mitigations. When you are identifying threats in your own architecture, it is recommended you apply STRIDE to each process and connection—this is known as STRIDE per element.      Spoofing   Spoofing is when a person or program is able to masquerade as another person or program. To mitigate this, you will want to authenticate any requests that are made and ensure that they are legitimate. Within the OWASP API Top 10, one of
