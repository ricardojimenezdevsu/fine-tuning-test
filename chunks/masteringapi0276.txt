will be interacting with your APIs:  Do you need to support IoT devices and the Device Authorization Grant?    Do you have older clients that are SPAs that only support the Implicit Grant?    Should you outright forbid the use of the Resource Owner Password Credential Grant?      If you already have a security model for authentication and authorization, should you move to OAuth2?  Which grant best represents your interaction model?    Will the clients be able to migrate to the grant? If they are under your control or you have a small number of third parties, this will be significantly easier to start getting third parties to migrate.    Should all new onboarded clients use the new OAuth2 Grant?      Recommendations  We recommend that you use OAuth2 and use only the grants you need and add more if required. If you have a security model in place that works and many paying customers, it may not be feasible to force them to migrate over to use OAuth2. However, you may have to evolve your security architecture to use OAuth2 to be more standard, as this can also be a request from third parties so they do not need to build a custom interaction for your security model. Starting with the Client Credentials Grant is often the easiest way to introduce OAuth2 into an API system.      OAuth2 Scopes   Scopes are an important mechanism in OAuth2 and are effectively used to limit the access of a client acting on behalf of a user. When a user first authenticates, the end user receives a
