designed into a zone-based architecture, which prompted the evolution of a new approach: that of zero trust.      Trust No One and Verify   The zero trust security model, also known as zero trust architecture or perimeterless security, describes an approach to the design and implementation of modern network systems. The main concept behind the zero trust security model is “never trust, always verify,” which means that devices should not be trusted by default, even if they are connected to a permissioned network such as a corporate LAN and even if they were previously verified. The reasoning for zero trust is that the traditional approach—trusting devices within a notional “corporate perimeter,” or devices connected via a VPN—is not relevant in the complex environment of a corporate network. The zero trust approach advocates mutual authentication, including checking the identity and integrity of devices without respect to location, and providing access to applications and services based on the confidence of device identity and device health in combination with user authentication.  The eight principles outlined in our guidance will help you to implement your own zero trust network architecture in an enterprise environment. The principles are:  Know your architecture, including users, devices, services, and data.    Know your user, service, and device identities.    Assess your user behavior, device, and service health.    Use policies to authorize requests.    Authenticate and
