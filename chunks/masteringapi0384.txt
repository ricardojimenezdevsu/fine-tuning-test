and this has fed into working in the security space for building APIs.      Colophon   The animal on the cover of Mastering API Architecture is an armadillo girdled lizard (Ouroborus cataphractus), previously in the genus Cordylus.  Armadillo girdled lizards live in the desert on the western coast of south Africa. They are often compared to miniature dragons in appearance: light or dark brown scales and yellow underbellies with black patterns. As far as size, they are typically between 7.5 and 9 centimeters in snout vent length (which does not include the tail).  They live in groups and are active during the day, although most of their active time is spent sunbathing. Their diet consists primarily of small insects (mostly termites), and they brumate (go into partial hibernation) during the winter. Unlike most lizards, which lay eggs, armadillo girdled lizards give birth to live young, one or two at a time about once a year. The females may also feed their young, another unusual behavior for lizards.  Their defense mechanism against predators is to roll into a ball and hold their tails in their mouths. This makes them look like mythical ouroboros, which is a symbol of wholeness or infinity. This unique behavior is the reason for their name, as mammalian armadillos also curl up in a ball.  The conservation status of the armadillo girdled lizard is “near threatened.” Many of the animals on O’Reilly covers are endangered; all of them are important to the world.  The cover
