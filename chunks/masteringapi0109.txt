and timeouts/retries, and can provide metrics, logs, and trace data in order to support the implementation of observability within the system. Many API gateways provide additional features that enable developers to manage the lifecycle of an API, assist with the onboarding and management of developers using the APIs (such as providing a developer portal and related account administration and access control), and provide enterprise governance.      Where Is an API Gateway Deployed?   An API gateway is typically deployed at the edge of a system, but the definition of “system” in this case can be quite flexible. For startups and many small-medium businesses (SMBs), an API gateway will often be deployed at the edge of the data center or the cloud. In these situations there may only be a single API gateway (deployed and running via multiple instances for high availability) that acts as the front door for the entire backend estate, and the API gateway will provide all of the edge functionality discussed in this chapter via this single component.  Figure 3-2 shows how clients interact with an API gateway and backend systems over the internet.      Figure 3-2. A typical startup/SMB API gateway deployment      For large organizations and enterprises, an API gateway will typically be deployed in multiple locations, often as part of the initial edge stack at the perimeter of a data center, and additional gateways may be deployed as part of each product, line of business, or
