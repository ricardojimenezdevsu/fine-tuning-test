want to allow consumers to construct their own queries?  What versioning considerations do we need to have?  What is the deployment/change frequency of the underlying data model?  Is this a high-traffic service where bandwidth or performance concerns have been raised?    Recommendations  If the API is consumed by external users, REST is a low barrier to entry and provides a strong domain model. External users also usually means that a service with loose coupling and low dependency is desirable.  If the API is interacting between two services under close control of the producer or the service is proven to be high traffic, consider gRPC.      Multiple Specifications   In this chapter we have explored a variety of API formats to consider in an API architecture, and perhaps the final question is “Can we provide all formats?” The answer is yes, we can support an API that has a RESTful presentation, a gRPC service, and connections into a GraphQL schema. However, it is not going to be easy and may not be the right thing to do. In this final section, we will explore some of the options available for a multiformat API and the challenges it can present.      Does the Golden Specification Exist?   The .proto file for attendees and the OpenAPI Specification do not look too dissimilar; they contain the same fields and both have data types. Is it possible to generate a .proto file from an OAS using the openapi2proto tool? Running openapi2proto --spec spec-v2.json will output the .proto
