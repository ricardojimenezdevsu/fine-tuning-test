identify and understand potential weaknesses? Architects and security experts can then collaborate on addressing these problems and work together to explore different angles of attack. The good news is that to conduct a threat modeling exercise, you do not need to be a security expert yourself, but you need to think like an attacker or bad actor.  Thinking like an attacker is often easier than you think, as you do it all the time (just by asking yourself “what would the attacker do?”)! For example, when you park your car in the evening, what do you do with your car keys? Do you leave them in the car? Probably not if it is left on the street, though you may if it is in a garage. You could leave the keys by the front door. However, someone could use a coat hanger through the letter box to take your keys, or, if a wireless car, the attacker could use signal amplification. So do you take them upstairs? And with the rise of electronic locking systems and immobilizers, do you put them in a Faraday cage? What you are doing here is looking at a situation and evaluating the threat and weighing up the risk. You now need to apply this approach to designing software systems, with a little help from existing well-defined methodologies.      How to Threat Model   As with many methodologies within software design and development, there are well-defined goals, approaches, and techniques to threat modeling that architects and engineers have refined over the years. The high-level approach to
