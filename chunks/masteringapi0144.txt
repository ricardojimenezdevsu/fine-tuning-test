API gateway is the “build versus buy” dilemma. This is not unique to this component of a software system, but the functionality offered via an API gateway does lead to some engineers gravitating to this—that they could build this “better” than existing vendors, or that their organization is somehow “special” and would benefit from a custom implementation. In general, we believe that the API gateway component is sufficiently well-established that it is typically best to adopt an open source implementation or commercial solution rather than build your own. Presenting the case for build versus buy with software delivery technology could take an entire book, and so in this section we only want to highlight some common challenges:  Underestimating the total cost of ownership (TCO)  Many engineers discount the cost of engineering a solution, the continued maintenance costs, and the ongoing operational costs.    Not thinking about opportunity cost  Unless you are a cloud or platform vendor, it is highly unlikely that a custom API gateway will provide you with a competitive advantage. You can deliver more value to your customers by building some functionality closer to your overall value proposition.    Not being aware of current technical solutions of products  Both the open source and commercial platform component space move fast, and it can be challenging to keep up-to-date. This, however, is a core part of the role of being a technical leader.      ADR Guideline: Selecting an API
