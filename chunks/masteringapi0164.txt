triggers an application behavior. For example, if an API call from the Attendee service to the Session service to get an attendee’s daily session schedule repeatedly fails, you may trigger a circuit breaker in the service mesh that rapidly fails all calls to this service (to allow the service to recover). Most likely within the mobile application you would handle this failure by “falling back” to rendering the entire conference session schedule rather than a personal schedule.      Advanced traffic routing: Shaping, policing, splitting, and mirroring   Since the dot-com boom of the late ’90s, consumer web applications have increasingly handled more users and more traffic. Users have also become more demanding, both in regards to performance and features offered. Accordingly, the need to manage traffic to meet the needs of security, performance, and feature release has become more important. As you learned in “How Does an API Gateway Integrate with Other Technologies at the Edge?”, the edge of the network saw the emergence of dedicated appliances to meet these requirements, but this infrastructure was not appropriate to deploy in front of every internal service. In this section of the chapter you will learn more about the requirements that have become typical for a microservices-based application in regards to internal traffic shaping and policing.      Traffic shaping   Traffic shaping is a bandwidth management technique that delays some or all of the network traffic in order
