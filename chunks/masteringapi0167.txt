particularly application (L7) and network (L4) metrics, and do so transparently. A corresponding update of any telemetry collection components or the service mesh itself should not require a redeployment of all applications. There are, of course, limitations to the observability a service mesh can provide, and you should also instrument your services using language-specific metrics and log-emitting libraries. For example, in our case study the service mesh would provide metrics on the number, latency, and error rate of Session service API calls, and you would also typically decide to log business-specific metrics and KPIs of the API calls.      Enforce Security: Transport Security, Authentication, and Authorization   In much the same way as observability, service-to-service communication security has historically been implemented using language-specific libraries. These highly coupled approaches provide the same drawbacks and nuances. For example, implementing transport-level encryption within an internal network is a relatively common requirement, but different language libraries handle certificate management differently, which increased the operational burden of deploying and rotating certificates. Managing both service (machine) and user (human) identity for authentication and authorization was also difficult across differing languages. It was also often easy to accidentally (or deliberately) circumvent any security implementation by not including the required libraries.
