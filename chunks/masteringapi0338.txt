pointing toward service mesh being merged with modern platform offerings. If this trend continues, it may be wise to adopt the mesh integrated within your chosen vendor’s technology stack. In much the same way that the majority of organizations adopting a cloud vendor’s Kubernetes stack don’t replace the container (OCI) or networking (CNI) implementations, it may well be the same in the future with the service-to-service communications. As part of this evolution, we recommend keeping watch on related standards in this space, such as the Service Mesh Interface (SMI). The emergence and adoption of solid interfaces surely point toward this layer of the communication stack being homogenized.      What’s Next: How to Keep Learning About API Architecture   We began this book by mentioning that all three of us started the journey that ultimately led to the creation of this book in February 2020 at the O’Reilly Software Architecture Conference (SACON). We all love learning, and attending events is a big part of our continued approach to gaining new skills and knowledge. One of the most common general questions we get asked relates to how we approach learning and experimenting with new technologies. In this section of the chapter, we’ll share with you our practices, insights, and habits.      Continually Honing the Fundamentals   We all believe that it is vitally importantly to constantly revisit the fundamentals of any skill you wish to master. This is especially important in such a
