definitions of other separate components. Components in a loosely coupled system can be replaced with alternative implementations that provide the same services and are less constrained to the same platform, language, operating system, or build environment.  Designing or refactoring toward a loosely coupled API will enable providers and consumers to evolve their systems more effectively. As a provider, a loosely coupled API will enable the maximum adoption of your service across the organization, both from the perspectives of ease of integration and supporting ease of change. And for consumers, an API that is loosely coupled will support easier swapping of components (potentially even at runtime), allow easier testing, and reduce the cost of managing dependencies.      Loose Coupling Enables Easier Mocking and Virtualizing When Testing!   An API designed with loose coupling in mind will typically be much easier to mock or virtualize when performing integration and end-to-end testing. A loosely coupled API enables the provider implementation to be easily swapped. When testing a consumer, the provider API implementation can be swapped for a simple stub or virtual service that returns the required response.  In comparison, it is often not possible to mock or stub an API that is highly coupled. Instead you will find yourself running the API provider as part of your test set or attempting to use a lightweight (less functional) or embedded version of the service.      Case Study:
