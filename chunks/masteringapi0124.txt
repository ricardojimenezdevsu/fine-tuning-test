platform, now is the time to potentially think about the trade-offs with multiple layers and specialist teams.      Early 2010s: First-Generation API Gateways   The late 2000s and early 2010s saw the emergence of the API economy and associated technologies. Organizations like Twilio were disrupting telecommunications, with their founder, Jeff Lawson, pitching that “We have taken the entire messy and complex world of telephony and reduced it to five API calls.” The Google Ads API was enabling content creators to monetize their websites, and Stripe was enabling larger organizations to easily charge for access to services. Founded in late 2007, Mashape was one of the early pioneers in attempting to create an API marketplace for developers. Although this exact vision didn’t pan out (arguably it was ahead of its time, looking now to the rise of “no code”/“low code” solutions), a byproduct of the Mashape business model was the creation of the Kong API Gateway, built upon OpenResty and the open source NGINX implementation. Other implementations included WSO2 with Cloud Services Gateway, Sonoa Systems with Apigee, and Red Hat with 3Scale Connect.  These were the first edge technologies that were targeted at developers in addition to platform teams and sysadmins. A big focus was on managing the software development lifecycle (SDLC) of an API and providing system integration functionality, such as endpoints and protocol connectors, and translation modules.
