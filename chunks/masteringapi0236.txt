ability to be traced. Repudiability threats are associated with users (malicious or otherwise) who can deny a wrongdoing without any way to prove otherwise.    Information disclosure  Compromising the user’s private or business-critical information. Information disclosure threats expose information to individuals who are not supposed to see it. A user’s ability to read a file that she or he was not granted access to, as well as an intruder’s ability to read the data while in transit between two computers, are both disclosure threats. Note that this threat differs from a spoofing threat in that here the perpetrator gets access to the information directly rather than by having to spoof a legitimate user.    Denial of Service  Making the system temporarily unavailable or unusable, such as those attacks that could force a reboot or restart of the user’s machine. When an attacker can temporarily make the system resources (processing time, storage, etc.) unavailable or unusable, we have a denial of service threat. We must protect against certain types of DoS threats for improved system availability and reliability. However, some types of DoS threats are very hard to protect against, so at a minimum, we must identify and rationalize such threats.7    Elevation of privilege  An unprivileged user gains privileged access and thereby has sufficient access to completely compromise or destroy the entire system. The more dangerous aspect of such threats is compromising the system in
