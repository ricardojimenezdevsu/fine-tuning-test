the threat shown in Figure 6-6. This threat is a DDoS attack against the API gateway where no rate limiting is in place.      Figure 6-6. Data flow diagram TCP spoofing threat      Here is the ranking of this threat:  Damage: 8  There is no rate limiting in place. This is a serious cause for concern as it allows anyone to send as many requests to the API gateway as they like, and potentially overload it, making it unusable.    Reproducibility: 8  Calling the API gateway repeatedly with many requests every second will start to degrade and eventually stop the gateway from working.    Exploitability: 5  The attacker can be outside our network to start attempting to run a DoS attack. The API gateway first checks the authentication and authorization to enforce the request. This means that the request must come from one of our legitimate and known client applications that integrate with our system.    Affected Users: 10  This can have devastating effects because if the gateway is unavailable, it will affect all our users.    Discoverability: 10  This is trivial to discover for anyone wanting to exploit and cause damage to our system.      The total score is (8 + 8 + 5 + 10 + 10) / 5 = 8.2.  It is worth noting that the values assigned to the risk are subjective. To get a somewhat consistent rating, for each category you should define what the values meanâ€”for example, if all users are affected, the score is 10; if all internal or all external users are affected, the score is 7; if
