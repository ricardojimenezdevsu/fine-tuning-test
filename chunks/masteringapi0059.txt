one north–south request will involve multiple east–west exchanges. High east–west traffic exchange needs to be efficient to avoid cascading slow-downs propagating back to the consumer.      High-Traffic Services   In our example, Attendees is a central service. In a microservices-based architecture, components will keep track of an attendeeId. APIs offered to consumers will potentially retrieve data stored in the Attendee service, and at scale it will be a high-traffic component. If the exchange frequency is high between services, the cost of network transfer due to payload size and limitations of one protocol versus another will be more profound as usage increases. The cost can present itself in either monetary costs of each transfer or the total time taken for the message to reach the destination.      Large Exchange Payloads   Large payload sizes may also become a challenge in API exchanges and are susceptible to decreasing transfer performance across the wire. JSON over REST is human readable and will often be more verbose than a fixed or binary representation fuelling an increase in payload sizes.      Tip   A common misconception is that “human readability” is quoted as a primary reason to use JSON in data transfers. The number of times a developer will need to read a message versus the performance consideration is not a strong case with modern tracing tools. It is also rare that large JSON files will be read from beginning to end. Better logging and error handling can
