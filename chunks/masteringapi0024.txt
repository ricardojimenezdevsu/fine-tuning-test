study:  In Chapter 1 you will explore the design and specification of the Attendee API. We will also present the importance of versioning and modeling exchanges for performance of the Attendee API.    In Chapter 2 you will explore contract and component testing to verify behavior of the Attendee service. You will also see how Testcontainers can help with integration testing.    In Chapter 3 you will look at exposing the Attendee service to consumers using an API gateway. We will also demonstrate how to evolve the conference system using an API gateway on Kubernetes.    In Chapter 4 we will refactor the sessions functionality out of the legacy conference system using a service mesh. You will also learn about how service mesh helps with routing, observability, and security.    In Chapter 5 we will discuss feature flagging and how this can help to evolve the conference system and avoid a coupled deployment and release. You will also explore approaches for modeling releases in the conference system and we will demonstrate the use of Argo Rollouts for the Attendee service.    In Chapter 6 you will explore how to apply threat modeling and mitigate OWASP concerns in the Attendee service.    In Chapter 7 you will look at authentication and authorization and how this is implemented for the Attendee service.    In Chapter 8 you will look at establishing the Attendee service domain boundaries and how different service patterns can help.    In Chapter 9 you will look at cloud adoption
