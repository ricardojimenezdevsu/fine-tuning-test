of software load balancers, and we recommend learning about the basics of this technology.    This time frame also saw the rise of other edge technologies that still required specialized hardware implementation. Content delivery networks (CDNs), primarily driven by the need to eliminate performance bottlenecks of the internet, began to be increasingly adopted in order to offload requests from origin web servers. Web application firewalls (WAFs) also began to see increasing adoption, first implemented using specialized hardware, and later via software. The open source ModSecurity project, and the integration of this with the Apache Web Server, arguably drove mass adoption of WAFs.      Mid-2000s: Application Delivery Controllers (ADCs)   The mid-2000s continued to see the increasing pervasiveness of the web in everyday life. The emergence of internet-capable phones only accelerated this, with BlackBerry initially leading the field, and everything kicking into a higher gear with the launch of the first iPhone in 2007. The PC-based web browser was still the de facto method of accessing the web, and the mid-2000s saw the emergence of “Web 2.0” alongside widespread adoption in browsers of the XMLHttpRequest API and the corresponding technique named Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (Ajax). At the time, this technology was revolutionary. The asynchronous nature of the API meant that no longer did an entire HTML page have to be returned, parsed, and the display completely refreshed
