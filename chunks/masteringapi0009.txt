such as the cloud      And you will be able to:  Design, build, and test API-based systems    Help to implement and drive an organization’s API program from an architectural perspective    Deploy, release, and configure key components of an API platform    Deploy gateways and service meshes based on case studies    Identify vulnerabilities in API architecture and implement measured security mitigations    Contribute to emerging API trends and the associated communities      What This Book Is Not   We realize that APIs encompass a vast market space and we want to be clear what this book will not cover. That doesn’t mean to say that we believe these topics are not important; however, if we tried to cover everything we wouldn’t be able to share our knowledge effectively with you.  We will cover application patterns for migration and modernization that will include taking advantage of cloud platforms, but the book is not wholly focused on cloud technologies. Many of you will have hybrid architectures or even have all of your systems hosted in data centers. We want to ensure that we cover the design and operational factors of API architectures that support both approaches.  The book is not tied to a specific language but will use some lightweight examples to demonstrate approaches to building/designing APIs and their corresponding infrastructure. The book will focus more on the approach, and code examples will be available in the accompanying GitHub repository.  The book does not
