us to rewrite our Attendee service using a different language (perhaps to meet new performance requirements) and still rely on the cross-functional aspects of service-to-service communication being handled consistently.      Separating Ingress and Service-to-Service Traffic Management   Recall in “Case Study: An Evolutionary Step” that we briefly introduced the key concepts of north–south and east–west traffic. Generally speaking, north–south traffic is traffic that is ingressing from an external location into your system. East–west traffic is transiting internally from system-to-system or service-to-service. The definitions can become tricky when you look further into the definition of “your systems”; for example, does this definition extend to systems designed and operated by only your team, your department, your organization, or your trusted third-parties, etc.  Several contributors to the API space, including Marco Palladino from Kong, have argued that the use of north–south and east–west is largely irrelevant and is more of a hangup from the previous generation of computer networking when boundaries between systems were clearer. We’ll explore this argument in more detail in Chapter 9, as this touches the idea of API as a product (including API lifecycle management) and layer 7 and layer 4 service connectivity (from the OSI model of networking.) The differences between the core properties and features of ingress and service-to-service traffic are shown in Table 4-3.
