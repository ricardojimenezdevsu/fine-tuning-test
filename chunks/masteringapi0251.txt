HTTP headers. An attacker could send through additional HTTP headers to the Attendee API like X-Assert-Role=Admin or X-Impersonate=Admin. The attacker would hope that these headers will not be removed and are used internally, which may give some extra privileges.      Step 5: Evaluate Threat Risks   When you perform your own threat modeling and end up with a list of threats, it is important to understand the priority of fixing them. This is what Step 5 of the threat modeling process is about. To evaluate threats, you can employ a qualitative risk calculation known as DREAD. Like STRIDE, DREAD was developed at Microsoft. This methodology provides you with an approach to start adding risk values to threats. Although DREAD is no longer used by Microsoft, it is still used by many companies and promoted as a useful way to establish a metric on the risk of a threat.  DREAD has a simple scoring system based on the underlying acronym:  Damage  How bad would an attack be?    Reproducibility  Can an attack be easily reproduced?    Exploitability  How easy is it to mount a successful attack?    Affected Users  How many users are impacted?    Discoverability  What is the likelihood of this threat being discovered?      Each threat is scored against these DREAD categories, where each category is scored from 1â€“10. The risk value assigned to a threat is (Damage + Reproducibility + Exploitability + Affected User + Discoverability) / 5.  In this example for our case study, you will look at
