orchestrate the release of application services, the configuration is also continually being updated. It is critical to be able to detect and resolve issues and mitigate any risks. Many of the points discussed in “API Gateway as a Single Point of Failure” can be applied to understanding and managing service mesh failure.      Common Service Mesh Implementation Challenges   As service mesh technologies are newer in comparison with API gateway technologies, some of the common implementation challenges are yet to be discovered and shared widely. However, there are a core set of antipatterns to avoid.      Service Mesh as ESB   With the emergence of service mesh plug-ins or traffic filters, and supporting technologies like Web Assembly (Wasm), it is increasingly tempting to think of service meshes as offering ESB-like functionality, such as payload transformation and translation. For all the reasons already discussed throughout this book, we strongly discourage adding business functionality or coupling too many “smarts” with the platform or infrastructure.      Service Mesh as Gateway   As many service mesh implementations provide some form of ingress gateway, we have seen organizations wanting to adopt an API gateway but instead choosing to deploy a service mesh and only using the gateway functionality. The motivation makes sense, as engineers in the organization realize that they will soon want to adopt service mesh–like functionality, but their biggest pain point is managing
