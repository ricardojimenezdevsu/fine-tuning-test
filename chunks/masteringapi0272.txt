application.      Figure 7-7. Authorization Code Grant + PKCE      You may be looking at these steps and wondering how this maps back to the Authorization Code Grant without PKCE. The diagram looks different from Figure 7-6, but the only real difference is the first step, Step A. In Step A of Figure 7-7, it is all about the authorization request (like in the abstract protocol Step A), and the process will be the same as in the Authorization Code Grant in Steps A and B.      Tip   PKCE must be used for public clients. However, you can use PKCE for confidential clients as well as for additional protection.    The Authorization Code Grant and its PKCE extension will work in the most common scenarios for your public and confidential clients when you have an end user in your case.      Case Study: Accessing Attendee API with the Authorization Code Grant   There are two client applications for accessing the Attendee API. Both of these applications will use the Authorization Code Grant to access the Attendee API on behalf of users (the resource owners). The External CFP system is a confidential client. The client can maintain a secret, which means that Authorization Code Grant can be used. The mobile application is a public client, and it is not able to maintain a secret, therefore Authorization Code Grant + PKCE must be used. The steps for the External CFP system and the mobile application requesting an access token and using them to access the Attendee service are shown in Figure
