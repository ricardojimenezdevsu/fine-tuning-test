Q: What Is a Proxy, Forward Proxy, and Reverse Proxy?
A: A proxy server, sometimes referred to as a forward proxy, is an intermediary server that forwards requests for content from multiple clients to different servers across the internet. A forward proxy is used to protect clients. For instance, a business may have a proxy that routes and filters employee traffic to the public internet. A reverse proxy server, on the other hand, is a type of proxy server that typically sits behind the firewall in a private network and routes client requests to the appropriate backend server. A reverse proxy is designed to protect servers.
WA1: A proxy is a type of virtual private network (VPN) that is used to access the internet.
WA2: A forward proxy is used to route traffic from the server to the client.
