Q3: What is a "seam"?
Correct answers:
CA1: A seam is a point where functionality is stitched together
Wrong answers:
WA1: It is a type of database error
WA2: It is when you consume an outdated service

Q4: What are the properties of a loosely coupled system?
Correct answers:
CA1: Components are weakly associated with each other.
Wrong answers:
WA1: Components do not know the definitions of other components.
WA2: Components are strongly associated with each other.
WA3: Components know definitions of other components.

Q5: Why is it a good idea to work with a loosely coupled API?
Correct answers:
CA1: Because provides more confidence and makes easier scalability.
Wrong answers:
WA1: Because provides the consumer with an easy way to use the services.
WA2: Because reduces the costs of integration and testing.
WA3: Because its the proper way of designing an API.

Q6: In the evolutionary process the first step is to define the goals, what is the classification of that goals?
Correct answers:
CA1: The goals can be functional and cross-functional.
Wrong answers:
WA1: The goals can be short-lived and long-lived.
WA2: The goals can be classified into their complexity.
WA3: The goals can be classified on the business stakeholders' priorities.

Q7: What is the goal of evolutionary architecture?
Correct answers:
CA1: Its to support a changing system.
Wrong answers:
WA1: Its to change the old components in the API.
WA2: Its to remove the spaghetti code from the system.
WA3: Its to migrate the monolithic architecture to a microservice architecture.

Q8: When there is a performance issue in the system the team must focus only on the module or component affected to optimize it.
Correct answers:
CA1: FALSE
Wrong answers:
WA1: TRUE

Q9: To break a dependency exists the sprout technique, what does the sprout technique consist of?
Correct answers:
CA1: It consists of creating the new functionality elsewhere, testing it, and including it in the legacy function.
Wrong answers:
WA1: It consists of renaming the legacy function and calling it after some logic into a new method named with the legacy functions original name.
WA2: It consists of creating a hit list of breaking changes and prioritizing them to resolve.

Q10: To break a dependency exists the wrap technique, what does the wrap technique consist of?
Correct answers:
