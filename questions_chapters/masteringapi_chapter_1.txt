Q2: What is the key difference between REST and RPC?

CA1: REST is stateless while RPC state depends on the implementation.
Wrong answers:
WA1: RPC is stateless while REST state depends on the implementation.
WA2: REST uses the HTTP protocol.

Q3: The main reason to use JSON in Rest API is that it is more readable for the developers
Correct answers:
CA1: FALSE
Wrong answers:
WA1: TRUE

Q4: When you are building an API you can see the term REST, what is REST?
Correct answers:
CA1: Representation State Transfer (REST) is a set of architectural constraints, most commonly applied using HTTP as the underlying transport protocol.
Wrong answers:
WA1: REST is a messaging protocol specification for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services in computer networks.
WA2: In distributed computing, a REST is when a computer program causes a procedure to execute in a different address space, which is coded as if it were a normal procedure call, without the programmer explicitly coding the details for the remote interaction.

Q5: When you are building an API you can see the term RPC, what is RPC?
Correct answers:
CA1: Its an API classification that involves calling a method in one process but having it execute code in another process.
Wrong answers:
WA1: Its a set of architectural constraints that are applied using the HTTP protocol.
WA2: Its a protocol in which the requests of an API are processed.
WA3: Remote Persistence Call.

Q6: What do you need to consider before extending an API to customers?
Correct answers:
CA1: You need to consider error handling.
Wrong answers:
WA1: You need to consider routing.
WA2: You need to consider pagination.
WA3: You need to consider caching.

Q7: What is the OpenAPI Specification?
Correct answers:
CA1: Its a representation of the API that describes it in detail for the consumers.
Wrong answers:
WA1: Its the API documentation.
WA2: Its a tool for generating REST APIs.
WA3: Its a standard in the IA segment.

Q8: Its true or false that OpenAPI has more strict specifications than gRPC.
Correct answers:
CA1: FALSE
Wrong answers:
WA1: TRUE

Q9: What is the upgrade option in which the API owner has to maintain old and new API versions?
Correct answers:
CA1: Release a new version and deploy it in a new location.
Wrong answers:
WA1: Release a new version of the API that is backward compatible.
WA2: Break compatibility with the previous API version.
WA3: Release major changes.

Q10: What does the major version represent in semantic versioning?
Correct answers:
CA1: It represents breaking changes with the previous version of the API.
Wrong answers:
WA1: It represents backward compatibility changes with the previous version of the API.
WA2: It represents bug fixes for an existing version of the API.

Q11: What does the minor version represent in semantic versioning?
Correct answers:
CA1: It represents backward compatibility changes with the previous version of the API.
Wrong answers:
WA1: It represents breaking changes with the previous version of the API.
WA2: It represents bug fixes for an existing version of the API.

Q12: What does the patch version represent in semantic versioning?
Correct answers:
CA1: It represents bug fixes for an existing version of the API.
Wrong answers:
WA1: It represents backward compatibility changes with the previous version of the API.
WA2: It represents breaking changes with the previous version of the API.
